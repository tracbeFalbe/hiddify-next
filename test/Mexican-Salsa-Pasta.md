Yes! I prefer elbow pasta because it's able to hold onto the sauce really well. However farfalle, rotini, fusilli, rigatoni, shell, and rotelle would also be great in this! You can also use gluten-free pasta! Just double-check the cooking instructions on the back of the packet and reduce or increase the simmering time as needed.

This pasta salad is very easy to make. Toss together cooked pasta, black beans, corn, chopped tomatoes, red onion, green onions, and chopped bell pepper in a large bowl. Whisk together salsa, cumin, and ranch dressing. Pour that over the pasta mixture and toss. Add in some fresh cilantro, if desired. I know some people have an aversion to cilantro. So it is totally optional. Pop it in the fridge for a few hours and you are set! The hardest part is boiling the pasta!!
 
As I said, this pasta salad is great for cookout and potlucks. It goes great with burgers, chicken, pork chops, and hot dogs. SO, pretty much everything! Here are a few of our favorite recipes from the blog that go great with this macaroni salad:
 
If you're tired of the same ol' pasta salads, you HAVE to try this easy **Mexican Pasta Salad**! It has so much flavor thanks to a secret ingredient in the dressing, and is seriously easy to make.
 
Salsa is the secret ingredient in this pasta salad dressing. I \*LOVE\* using salsa as part of a dressing, and I use it in my **3-ingredient chicken salad** and my **3-ingredient tuna salad** recipes. It just adds adds so much flavor and it's so easy to use.

I combine store-bought salsa (I love this **Pace salsa** for cooking!) with sour cream and mayo and it makes a great base for a creamy salad. If you want to go a bit healthier, skip the mayo and use low-fat sour cream, or sub some of the sour cream for plain unsweetened Greek yogurt.
 
I actually prefer packaged store-bought salsa for these kinds of dressings as opposed to fresh homemade salsa. There is something about the bottled salsa that makes it PERFECT for adding flavor to dressings.
 
But if you want to keep this pasta salad kid-friendly, I recommend using a mild salsa, and only adding - jalapeo, or even holding off on the jalapeo if you are not sure your family would like that. You can always add a splash of hot sauce if there is not enough heat, but you can't undo it once the jalapeo has infused into the dressing.
 
This Mexican spaghetti sauce (espagueti verde sauce) is a creamy, savory Mexican pasta sauce that is irresistible. This delicious sauce is made with roasted poblano peppers, spinach, onions, Serrano peppers, cilantro, and soaked cashews.
 
This delicious Mexican spaghetti is kind of like a Mexican pesto, that tastes nothing like Italian pesto haha. The sauce is delicious, savory, a tad bit spicy, and super creamy. It is perfect to toss pasta into but you can also use it as a salsa for tacos, chips, enchiladas, nachos, and so much more! I highly recommend making a double batch if you plan on making it for more than 2 people, it tastes better the day after too.
 
This espagueti verde (green spaghetti) is a creamy, savory Mexican pasta sauce that is absolutely irresistible. This delicious sauce is made with roasted poblano peppers, spinach, onions, Serrano peppers, cilantro, and soaked cashews.
 
This cheesy salsa verde taco pasta has tons of cheese and is full of flavor. A simple recipe that is both filling and satisfying, and can be on the dinner table in no time. Easy, cheesy, and delicious.
 
They are similar but not the same. Green enchilada sauce combines tomatillos and green chilis with stock or water and the ingredients are then cooked. Salsa verde is simply tomatillos, green chilis, and sometimes one or two other ingredients that are blended together and uncooked.
 
Add ground beef, onions, and garlic to a large saucepan, season with salt and pepper, and cook over medium-high heat until the ground beef is completely cooked. Drain the meat and add it back to the pan.

Miso tantanmen might change your mind-a hot Chinese import into ramen years ago. But it sounds like spicy curry beef stew noodles, from Thailand or Malaysia, would be more up your alley. I add hot salsa and olive oil to spaghetti because Italian food has the same problem as Japanese sometimes.
 
Fideo noodles, which I use elsewhere on the blog, are a kind of (often super skinny) spaghetti or angel hair, also often broken and toasted before using. At any rate, yes fideo noodles are a traditional way of using pasta in Mexican food but I was specifically creating a play on ramen bowls with this dish and specifically call for ramen noodles. As I note in the beginning the dish is not meant to be authentic or traditional, but rather a fusion of the craze for ramen soups of all kinds and Mexican flavors.
 
Cover the leftover Mexican Pasta Salad with plastic wrap or transfer it to an airtight container. Store in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. The longer the pasta salad is refrigerated, the drier it can become. If your leftovers taste too dry, then drizzle with additional olive oil to taste. You may also want to perk up the salad with salt and cayenne pepper to taste.

Amazing recipe. I made it Thursday and I had to make it again today. I used spicy chili powder and left out the avocado and black beans. It was such a hit that most of the leftovers were snuck out by our guests!!!!
 
I have made this several times and it is always a hit. Recently I made this with vegan mayo, no sour cream or cheese because I could not find vegan version but it worked out fine due to the texture of vegan mayo. It was still delicious! Thank you so much Jennifer your lovely recipes.

This recipe using **basic pantry ingredients** such as pasta, canned beans, salsa, and some taco seasoning.

This Mexican espagueti verde (green spaghetti) will knock your socks off! The roasted poblano cheese sauce is so delicious and creamy! Add jalapeo if you like the heat, and shrimp or chicken if you want meat!
 
**Electric stove:** broil them in the oven. Place on a cookie sheet, line with aluminum foil, and broil at high heat, turning with tongs every so often until charred and blistered all over.
 
Okay I did the recipe plus cooked chicken in a cast iron skillet and heated the sauce in there after taking the chicken out. Added chicken knorr seasoning to the pasta water. Then added a little muenster cheese to the finished product. SOOOOOO GOOOOD!
 
Hi Enid, the crema mexicana I'm referring to is Mexican-style sour cream and i
