Municipalities and counties are authorized to prepare comprehensive plans as a long-range guiding document for a community to achieve its vision and goals. The comprehensive plan(or master plan) provides the policy framework for regulatory tools like zoning, subdivision regulations, annexations, and other policies. A comprehensive plan promotes the community's vision, goals, objectives, and policies, establishes a process for orderly growth and development, addresses both current and long-term needs, and provides for a balance between the natural and built environment.(See Colorado Revised Statute 30-28-106 and 31-23-206.) Elements addressed in a comprehensive plan may include: recreation and tourism (required by state statutes), transportation, land use, economic development, affordable housing, environment, parks and open space, natural and cultural resources, hazards, capital improvements, water supply and conservation, efficiency in government, sustainability, energy, and urban design.
 
Many local governments hire a consultant to update their comprehensive plan. This American Planning Association link provide guidance to local governments on the process for selecting a consultant, including writing a Request for Proposal (RFP).

Below are links and short descriptions of sample comprehensive plans from a variety of county and municipalities in Colorado. (Note: These descriptions are not meant to be comprehensive or a judgment of the quality of each plan.)
 
The 2040 Comprehensive Plan (referred to as the Plan) outlines the community's vision for the future through a framework of goals and policies that support a thriving and healthy community comprised of great neighborhoods. The Plan is meant to be a living document that is updated over time to respond to changing conditions and the evolving needs of the community.
 
The Plan is one of a group of long-term planning efforts to create the framework for the future of Westminster. Five partner plans were developed in association with the Plan and are integral to achieve the city's Vision: Parks, Recreation and Libraries Plan; Transportation and Mobility Plan; Sustainability Plan; Water Supply Plan; and a sixth project - Unified Development Code - to update municipal codes relative to development to ensure the goals and policies of the Westminster Forward plans are actionable relative to land development. All parts of the Plan, in conjunction with partner plans, work together towards the realization of the city's vision for the future.
 
The remaining land inventory in the city is dominated by smaller parcels bypassed by previous developments. New development typically begins with the initial site planning and subdivision design with cost and unit yield being critical considerations. The neighborhood unit concept provides a context for considering the appropriateness of new development within the existing neighborhood fabric. Neighborhood units are primarily low density housing with a park or similar civic space as a focal point. Certain key edge locations may also support a mix of uses in cases where neighborhood services, infrastructure, and transit is available.
 
The Commissioners Court unanimously approved the LWTP on December 2, 2014. It was completed by the Travis County Transportation and Natural Resources (TNR) department as a framework for protecting land and water resources, building a comprehensive transportation system, and efficiently delivering related services in unincorporated Travis County. The County will continue to invite residents and stakeholders to participate as the County moves forward with its implementation, through Court approved updates of the plan and adoption of growth-related policies, ordinances, and regulations. Future plan uses are:

A Public Engagement Plan was implemented to share the Draft LWTP with the public, collect their feedback, and report back to the Commissioners Court on citizen comments about the Draft Plan. The goals of the Public Engagement Process were to create public awareness of the Draft Plan and generate participation of a broad range of stakeholders through a transparent process. The project team offered several different opportunities for Travis County residents to get involved, such as: attending meetings, interacting with our team out at community events, through their email and social media activities, or participating from the convenience of their own homes through an online presentation and survey. We received over 1,200 survey responses and collected more than 700 comments regarding the Draft LWTP.
 
The Florida Water Plan and the Florida Transportation Plan have been adopted. Through its review of planning activities, OIP assists with implementation of the Florida Water Plan, and the water supply plans of the five water management districts.
 
Growth management legislation was passed in 1985 in response to Florida's commitment to provide the facilities and services that communities need to foster economic growth and preserve natural amenities. The importance of comprehensive planning cannot be overstressed, because it results in decisions regarding long-term issues such as environmental protection and economic development. Section 163.3177, F.S., requires that local government comprehensive plans provide the policy foundation for local planning and land use decisions on capital improvements, conservation, intergovernmental coordination, recreation, open space, future land use, housing, transportation, coastal management (where applicable) and public facilities.
 
The review process is initiated when a local government transmits a proposed or adopted comprehensive plan amendment to the appropriate state and regional agencies, including DEP, Department of Economic Opportunity (DEO), Department of State, Department of Transportation, regional planning councils and water management districts. Other agencies that may be included in the review process are the Department of Education (if the amendment affects schools), Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (for county amendments); county governments (for municipal amendments); and the commanding officer of any affected military installation. The three review processes for amending comprehensive plans include the Expedited State Review, State Coordinated Review and Small Scale Review.
 
With the exception of small scale amendments, which involve land use changes on parcels of 10 acres or less (or 20 acres or less for parcels within rural areas of critical economic concern) and are exempt from state and regional review, most amendments proposed and later adopted by local governments are now reviewed through the Expedited State Review process. DEP and other state and regional agencies must provide comments directly to the local government within 30 days of receiving an expedited review amendment and copy DEO, the state land planning agency.
 
In both coordinated and expedited review processes, DEP provides comments addressing important state resources and facilities that will be adversely impacted by the amendment. DEP must state with specificity how the plan amendment will adversely impact an important state resource or facility and recommend measures the local government may take to eliminate, reduce or mitigate the adverse impacts. Through OIP, DEP comments on the following important state resources and facilities:
 
If there are issues that cannot be resolved, DEO may challenge an adopted plan amendment. Detailed guidelines for submittal and processing of comprehensive plan amendments may be found at the**DEO website**.
 
In 2015, Sugar Land began to develop a comprehensive plan to meet increasing groundwater regulations in 2025. The city selected the Integrated Water Resources Plan (IWRP) process as the best tool for completing this planning effort. The IWRP allows the city to evaluate policies, management strategies, and capital improvement projects while building consensus and support from city staff, citizens, and council members.
 
The IWRP process is used to evaluate a wide mix of water supply and demand management options while building consensus and support from decision makers and other stakeholders that will be affected by the recommendations.
 
It expands on the traditional water supply planning methodology of only considering the cost and yield of new supplies, and incorporates community goals like reliability, protecting the environment and system efficiency.
 
(a) A land use plan must include the water management plan required by section 103B.235, and shall designate the existing and proposed location, intensity and extent of use of land and water, including lakes, wetlands, rivers, streams, natural drainage courses, and adjoining land areas that affect water natural resources, for agricultural, residential, commercial, industrial and other public and private purposes, or any combination of such purposes.
 
(b) A land use plan must contain a protection element, as appropriate, for historic sites, the matters listed in the water management plan required by section 103B.235, and an element for protection and development of access to direct sunlight for solar energy systems.
 
(c) A land use plan must also include a housing element containing standards, plans and programs for providing adequate housing opportunities to meet existing and projected local and regional housing needs, including but not limited to the use of official controls and land use planning to promote the availability of land for the development of low and moderate income housing.
 
(d) A land use plan must also include the local government's goals, intentions, and priorities concerning aggregate and other natural resources, transportation
