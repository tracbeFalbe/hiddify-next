i like the goofy music, uh maybe its just mediocre but im nostalgic i guess, whatever the case im going to download it because i remember this being a very goofy game, nonetheless withregarding some of the game as being repetetive and linear, the music was nice, i wonder how many versions they have made of this game, maybe the music is worse on the later versions, that is usually the case
 
Growing up in Queens, Young saw as Hip-Hop made superstars out of local talents like Run-D.M.C. and LL COOL J. "When I was growing up in Hollis, there were a lot of things going on, some good things but a lot of bad things," he told The Washington Post in 1990. "So I saw rap as being one of the good things, and I gave it a shot. I didn't get the hang of it right at first. I was using variations on other people's lyrics, but I found out quickly you have to write your own. And I found out I was good at it."

Producers Mike King and John Simpson had a Hip-Hop radio show that caught the attention of a local L.A. artist named Tone-Loc, who was newly-signed to Delicious Vinyl. The label asked the duo to help with production and engineering and that subsequently led to work on both Loc's album and this single by Young MC. It was on "Bust A Move" that the duo decided to coin the name "the Dust Brothers."
 
"King and Simpson are pretty common names," Simpson explained to Sound On Sound. "And we decided that we'd better come up with a cool name. At the time we were bringing back music that no-one was listening to any more, so we wanted the name to be an anachronistic reference to things of the past. While we were working for Delicious Vinyl, many people had been describing our music as 'dusted,' and that's where we took the name from. The state of Hip-Hop was pretty minimal at the time, and we were doing these very textural, tripped-out, almost hallucinogenic remixes of things. Angel dust was just an additional whacked-out reference that also fitted with what we were doing."
 
On the heels of Loc reaching the Top Ten with "Wild Thing" and "Funky Cold Medina," Young dropped "Bust A Move." Both of those Tone Loc singles had been platinum-sellers, and "Bust A Move" followed suit, going all the way to No. 1 by summer 1989.
 
That summer was an interesting time for crossover success in Hip-Hop. N.W.A. had hit majorly in 1988 with Straight Outta Compton, and Public Enemy's It Takes A Nation of Millions To Hold Us Back was one of the most acclaimed albums of that year. With serious, angry rap records earning accolades and Hip-Hop's creative credibility more tied to socio-political commentary than ever, poppy acts like Young MC were suddenly primed for criticism.
 
At the same time that Delicious Vinyl was launching, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were just beginning to break through in 1989. The SoCal funk-rockers had developed a tremendous indie following but was reeling from the loss of founder/guitarist Hillel Slovak, who'd died of a heroin overdose in 1988. Recruiting John Frusciante as lead guitarist, the Chili Peppers would see their commercial breakthrough in 1989, with the success of their fourth album ﻿Mother's Milk ﻿and singles like "Knock Me Down" and a cover of Stevie Wonder's "Higher Ground" receiving tremendous MTV airplay. Bass player Flea was recruited to lay down the groove on "Bust A Move." He wasn't a household name yet, but his distinctive style drives the song.
 
The success of "Bust A Move" pushed Young MC's debut Stone Cold Rhymin' to No. 9 on the Pop Albums charts, and the hit song's video became an MTV staple throughout 1989. In the video, Flea makes a famous appearance wearing his distinctive stuffed-animal pants.
 
In the more than 30 years since "Bust A Move" topped the charts, it's found it's way into commercials and movies, it's become an enduring staple and holds up perfectly as a catchy slice of radio rap perfection. Young MC has dropped more albums and done more tours since "Bust A Move," but he appreciates the power of his biggest hit.
 
The Suns have been the feel-good story of the 2013-14 NBA season, but the warm feeling would wear off with a bad ending. The Suns could miss the playoffs because they are in a battle with three other teams -- Golden State, Memphis and Dallas - for the Western Conference's final three playoff slots. A strong close to the season could put the Suns in the playoffs for the first time since they went to the conference finals in 2010. The Suns are trying to avoid a fourth consecutive non-playoff season; the last time this happened was when they missed postseason play five straight seasons through 1974-75. The Suns will be the first to say they have to worry about their play first, but their chances also will be dictated by the rest of the field.
 
Memphis was four games below .500 before a home win against the Suns on Jan. 10 turned it into one of the hottest teams in the NBA. The Grizzlies became just as dangerous as they were last year once their big three - Marc Gasol, Zach Randolph and Mike Conley Jr. - got healthy and restored to the lineup. When Memphis was vulnerable to most of the league and struggling at home, the Suns were struggling right along with them. Phoenix lost all three meetings with Memphis, so the Suns would lose a head-to-head tiebreaker.
 
The Grizzlies missed Gasol, the heart of their defense, the most and the longest. Conley has been the steady hand at the wheel in his seventh season, with career-high scoring to go with his playmaking and defense. Memphis helped its depth by signing guard Courtney Lee and picking up forward James Johnson. Memphis might have the hardest schedule among the contenders for the final playoff spot in terms of a heavy road slate and opponents' record.
 
Golden State has turned hot at just the right time, playing the best basketball in the league other than San Antonio since the all-star break. It was only a matter of time before the Warriors took that next step as a franchise after last season's success and the addition of Andre Iguodala, which helped turn the Warriors into a top defensive team with center Andrew Bogut and reserve Draymond Green also contributing big on that end. Golden State has a go-to star in Stephen Curry, more shooting with Klay Thompson and an inside-out threat in David Lee to set them apart - the trio is averaging about 60 points per game.
 
Golden State, which made a key stretch run acquisition in Steve Blake, perhaps is the one team in this group that could still jump fading Portland for fifth place. The Warriors split the season series with the Suns but have an edge in the next tiebreaker, intra-conference record. Golden State, with one of the best home-court advantages in the league, has the most home-heavy remaining schedule of the quartet grappling for the final West playoff spots.
 
Dallas is the team most vulnerable (besides Phoenix) of falling out of the playoff mix. The Mavericks have a superstar in Dirk Nowitzki, but he also helps makes them an older team: he's 35, Shawn Marion is 35 and sixth-man Vince Carter is 37. In his 16th season, Nowitzki is nearly as efficient and productive as ever and now has a tag-team offensive weapon: Monta Ellis, who is shooting better than he has in six seasons. His penetrating ability, as a co-creator with Jose Calderon, makes Dallas one of the league's top offensive teams.
 
Although the Suns' defense has dipped badly in recent weeks, Dallas has played the worst defense of this group all season and is a poor rebounding team. Dallas has proven streaky down the stretch but has an eight-game homestand coming up March 17-April 1 where it could find a groove.
 
This could be a swing game for how the big three-game road trip goes. The Raptors are playing far better than when the Suns saw them three months ago at 6-12. It will be the Suns' first afternoon game of the season and a meeting of potential Coach of the Year candidates. It comes in a stretch of the schedule with eight of 11 games on the road and three road back-to-backs, including this one followed by a game at Brooklyn.
 
This might prove to be the weightiest game of them all. The Suns and Mavericks split two meetings in Phoenix and this is the Suns' only trip of the season to Dallas, making it the rubber match for a potential head-to-head tiebreaker. This will be the most hostile environment the Suns will see if playoff spots remain on the line in the final week of the season. It will be a tough test for the Suns, a night after playing at San Antonio and with the Mavericks at home resting.
 
The Suns already have lost the head-to-head tiebreaker with Memphis by dropping the teams' first three meetings, even before the Grizzlies got all their top players back. Nevertheless, if the Suns are in position to still finish outright ahead of Memphis in the standings, this final home game could prove to be huge, followed two days later by a very winnable game at Sacramento as the season finale.
