Staffed by an Interpretive Guide mid-July to Aug 31, visitors can learn about the lives of salmon and bears while capturing photographs and lasting memories. The Viewing Area is accessed by a short (.25 miles) gravel path from the parking area to the viewing platform. Interpretive signs at the site illustrate the ecological web of wildlife that utilize the stream and its resources. Wildlife viewing is excellent during the salmon run, with the opportunity to view birds and black bears. Watch salmon climb up the foaming waterfall or use the alternate fish ladder route.

Studies have found that aquarium-watching helps reduce stress and anxiety, increase feelings of relaxation, and decrease heart rate and muscle tension. In fact, staring at a fish tank for as little as five minutes has an almost hypnotic effect, calming us down because of our genetic predisposition to regard some natural environments as non-threatening and essential to survival.
 
In a previous study, conducted by the Center for Human-Animal Interaction at Virginia Commonwealth University, investigators looked at the effect of an aquarium on pre-treatment anxiety, fear, frustration, and depression in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) patients. Forty-two patients were rotated between rooms with and without fish tanks while awaiting treatment. While no participants showed significant changes in their blood pressure and heart rate, the average patient experienced 12 percent less anxiety in the presence of an aquarium.

Additional studies confirm that watching fish in an aquarium can be effective in reducing anxiety in patients awaiting dental surgery. Aquariums can also help adults and children with autism and ADHD.
 
The owner has added the following text to the video: "I bought my dog a fake fish tank and she is now an iPad child." This is because Millie appears to have lost all awareness of her surroundings and she is focused on the fake fish in the tank.
 
The video doesn't surprise other dog owners as they too own sociable canines who enjoy watching real fish swim around in their tanks. Previously, Newsweek shared an article about a corgi who struck up an unlikely friendship with his owner's fish.
 
The dog-walking company states it isn't unusual for a dog to become interested in a fish tank and they are likely to stare with their ears up. They may even wag their tail or you may see the whites of their eyes, meaning they are stressed.

Salmon poisoning disease (fish disease) is a potentially fatal condition seen in dogs who have ingested certain types of raw fish found in the Pacific Northwest from San Francisco to the coast of Alaska. It is most prevalent from northern California to the Puget Sound. It is also seen inland along the rivers of fish migration.
 
Salmon, trout, and other fish such as the lamprey, sculpin, redside shiner, shad, sturgeon, candlefish and the large-scale sucker who spend their lives in coastal streams and rivers in the Pacific Northwest can be infected with the organism Neorickettsia helmonthoeca.
 
The rickettsial organism Neorickettsia helmonthoeca is embedded within the fluke, Nanophyetus salmincola, which is embedded within raw fish. Once in the dog's intestinal tract, the larval flukes excyst and release the rickettsiae. The rickettsial organisms then hematogenously spread to the liver, lungs, brain, and lymphoid tissues causing necrosis, hemorrhage, and hyperplasia.
 
The life cycle begins when the eggs of the fluke Nanophyetus salmincola are released in the feces of the host mammal or avian. Those eggs may find their way into a freshwater snail, Oxytrema silicula, found only in coastal streams and rivers. Inside the snail these forms reproduce many times and encyst in fish tissues, which, if eaten, can cause illness in canines.
 
If not treated, salmon poisoning disease is usually fatal within 2 weeks after exposure. The symptoms of salmon poisoning disease are similar to other gastrointestinal diseases such as canine parvovirus. If infected, your dog would likely show some or all of the following symptoms about 6 to 10 days after ingesting fish which were carrying the bacteria. Symptoms may be of variable severity but generally consist of:
 
If you know your dog has ingested raw fish and it exhibits any of the symptoms listed above, notify your veterinarian immediately. If identified in time, salmon poisoning disease is treatable. A helpful part of the diagnosis is telling your veterinarian that your dog ate raw fish. If your dog roams, raids trash cans, or you are unsure of what it has eaten for any reason, be sure to mention this to your veterinarian, especially if your dog is exhibiting any of the symptoms.
 
The disease is diagnosed with analysis of a fecal sample to detect the parasite's eggs or by detecting the bacteria through a needle sample from a swollen lymph node. Treatment involves administration of an antibiotic to kill the bacteria and a dewormer to kill the parasite. If a dog is vomiting at the time of evaluation, it may need to be hospitalized for IV fluid administration. Many dogs respond to treatment quickly, showing improvement in just a few days. Once recovered, many dogs have a permanent immunity to the strain they were infected with. However, infection with an alternate strain can occur so precautions should still be taken.
 
Fortunately for canine lovers who are looking to get into fishkeeping, fish and dogs generally cohabitate well, mostly not interacting with one another, except perhaps for a dog who becomes entranced with the moving colors of the fish in the tank, just like humans do.
 
While integrating fish into a home already occupied by a dog is one of the easiest pet introductions to facilitate, there are still a few things all dog owners should know before bringing Nemo home to meet Fido for the first time.
 
Unlike a cat, your dog is unlikely to see your new fish tank as a food source or a source of much interest at all. Dogs are not typically visual creatures, and even the brightest and most beautiful cherry shrimp in the world is unlikely to hold their attention based on color alone. Instead, dogs are attracted and intrigued based on smells and sounds, neither of which a fish tank produces much of. Because of this, it is entirely possible, even likely, that your dog will be interested by the tank for the first few days and then quickly become unconcerned about it.
 
Since there is no way to know how invested your dog will be in your fish tank until it is set up and stocked, dogs should always be introduced to the fish in a carefully controlled environment. In most cases, that means a dog on a leash being allowed to sniff and examine the new fish tank, with their human ready to remove them from the situation if they get too excited or overly worked up. A dog that is too interested in the fish might have their ears up, wag their tails, stalk or crouch in front of the tank, or stare intensely at the fish. Any dog showing these signs probably is not ready to be around the fish.
 
While dogs are unlikely to intentionally kill or eat the fish in a fish tank, they may still unintentionally do harm to the tank and its occupants, as well as, potentially, themselves. A curious dog exploring the tank without being aware of its surroundings might knock the tank over, or climb on top of it and fall in. Both of these scenarios are likely to kill your fish, injure your dog, and, if nothing else, create a huge mess in your house. This is why dogs should be supervised around fish tanks and dogs that are overly invested in a fish tank should be kept away from it.
 
This means both safety of the tank from the dog and the safety of the dog in case of accidents. Tanks should be high enough that dogs cannot easily reach them, and far enough away from other furniture that dogs cannot crawl over to the tank from the top of the couch or another table. Aquarists should also take care that they only place their tank on sturdy, stable pieces of furniture that cannot be knocked over by (or onto) a dog. It may also be necessary to set up the tank in an area the dog has no access to, in order to prevent accidents.
 
No matter how chill or well-conditioned a dog is, it is never a good idea to leave them unsupervised around a fish tank, as even a briefly curious dog can have disastrous consequences. This may mean containing the dog or closing off rooms before leaving the house, or even setting up the tank away from the dog entirely. Remember that no matter how much you trust your dog, it only takes a minute of uncharacteristic behavior for a previously friendly cohabitation to change drastically for the worse.
 
While owners should remain alert for their dog showing any undue interest in the fish tank, and take
