Ok guys, need some help. A guy at work gave me a 360 for free. It's the old type with no HDMI port. I've booted it up and it's kernel is 9199. I understand I can't jtag it but can I do anything else worthwhile with it?

So believe it or not I still have my launch day 360. What are my options when it comes to modding. I haven't played around with modded consoles since the original xbox. Im basically after a way to play backups of my original games on one 360 and a disc in the other console I have in another room. Any help would be appreciated.
 
If you put your LOT and MFR date into you should find other consoles from the same time, this will give you a good idea of what type of DVDRom you have. You can then determine the best path to extracting the info you need.
 
Thats it!
installing it is easy....getting the key out is easy/hard depending on what drive you have
if its a launch console it probably a Samsung drive. If you a lucky you might have a Hitachi as they communicate with pretty much every PC without special hardware. Samsung drives...bit of a hit and miss but usually you need a motherboard with a Via chipset, or a via PCI sata card...
 
You are in Melbourne...we offer to get the key out for a tenner if you open your console up and just give us your drive (while buying an xk3y of course) save you having to pull your hair out
Thanks but I'll attempt it myself first, I do like to tinker and it's more satisfying to get it going myself ;)
I just bought a VIA sata card off ebay, not sure if I need it though as I believe I have a Hitachi drive.
Just have to wait for it to arrive. With a bit of luck I'll be able to order an xk3y in a couple of weeks.

Yeah its the Hitachi-LG.. I do have another that is Samsung-Toshiba (I need to repair the RROD). So the VIA card isn't a complete waste. It was only $9 anyways. I might attempt it this weekend (provided to many beers aren't consumed :P). Is the xk3y remote particularly needed? Also is there anything to worry about with xbox live? I know nothing is guaranteed but is it common for xk3ys to be detected?
 
You can use without, its like using a PC without a screen. It can be done, but troubleshooting close to impossible as you cannot see whats going on. Was never meant to be sold without the screen, but it works without, so you can give it a go I guess. 
You will need to use the on screen menu, and enable that through an update to the xk3y.
 
Never detected for just normal use. the on screen menu is said to be easily detectable if Microsoft wanted to add checks for it, but clearly they don't care at the moment and its been used for almost 2 years and they haven't banned anyone for using it...
 
XekToReX and OMC I thank you both for your help. Sorry for the noob questions. Its a shame I didn't get on this earlier. 
And yes sometimes I am known to have to many beers, not that I really remember :D
I'll have a go at flashing this weekend and attempt to repair my other xbox while I'm at it. I'll let you know how I go. Its just a matter of getting my head around jungle flasher now. It doesn't look to hard, I just hope I don't kill the drive.
Again thanks guys
 
Given my 360's manufacture date the drive is listed as being a Hitachi dln10N, which according to the ozmodchips site is possible through RGH only whatever that means. There's then a link to identify drive type which comes up with a picture of two drives disc trays, according to the pics my drive is a liteon, so now I'm really confused.
 
saints row 4 and SP: Blacklist and it wasnt the full audio cutting out just parts. like the engine noise of a car when driving, menu music and peoples speech but all other game audio was playing. BUT strange thing my xkey just spat out a e64 error and after i restarted the console the sound isnt playing up now. weird.
 
Hmm so I'm on the last day of the compatible drives but I really could have either as its only 1 days difference.., is that what ur saying? Would I be better of buying a refurb phat for 80 and flashing the drive, would that allow me to play games from HDD or just burnt disks.
 
It is as easy and that (depending on which hack you get), once it done. 
Its jus that Microsoft/Sony are not silly like Nintendo, and if there are software hacks available for their console they close them instantly, and don't leave them open for 3 years without an update :)
 
Take a USB stick in with your console and OMC will put your firmware file on it for you so you don't have to take your console apart to grab it from the SD Card, back it up to dropbox or something like that also.
 
Worse I'm on the mid north coast of NSW :/ is the firmware specific to the individual drive or is it the same for all drives of that model? Coz I'd happily pay just to have the firmware emailed to me or posted via USB, saves shelling out 70 bucks for the gecko
 
Hey guys I had my Xbox DVD drive firmware flashed years ago, since then I stopped playing backed up games and several games have updated my dashboard and can no longer play any of the backed up games I had, no biggy. But I'm considering getting Xbox live and wondering if I play a game online, even though it's a legit copy is there any chance I'll get that account banned? Cheers
 
I hate coming across as someone who hasn't done their research, but every time i look into the 360 modding stuff i just get overwhelmed. I have a bit of time on my hands at the moment so i want to get it done.
 
I have a Falcon that is banned from live, has a dead disk drive, but from memory is on a JTaggable dashboard version, i also have a Jasper that is also banned from live, but not particularly useful currently due to having an old iextreme firmware on it.
 
Although Fat 360's can have reliability issues, i have two, so if one dies, i don't really care, and neither of them has ever had any issues (though one hasn't been used for over a year and the other hasn't been used for a few years).
 
I already said that i am more than happy to do it myself, as the prices for components i have seen thus far have led me to believe that i could do both for a lot less than it would cost to get someone to do them. I also have seen nothing that seems particularly outside of my skillset, there seems to be pretty easy to follow tutorials out there, it is just getting my head around which method is the best choice that is the issue as the more i read, the more conflicting opinions i read.
 
okay ive managed to get the file from google and it finds those two files xenon elf and vmlinux and then it goes to a black command screen that 'initialize controller' but after that it just stops these are the last 3 lines
 
**UPDATE**
i finally update my xbox, now trying to boot it, do i need to update FSD? i launched a game and it said unable to start or something..now FSD takes ages to load to the homescreen from the welcome to f3 page like 5 minutes +
 
Thinking about going the xkey route for my 4gig slim, and after looking at a few installaion videos, I'm pretty confident I can install it myself but I'm trying to figure out if I will need the key extracted from my drive or mobo....mfr date is 2011-08-17, so that would mean i have the liteon 16d4s drive, correct ? Does this mean I will require the RGH to get my key info ??
 
I am contemplating going down the modding route for one of my 360 consoles. I would only use it to run games directly off the hard drive. I would still keep one of my consoles for legitimate online play and to keep my gamertag alive. I'm not as crazy about my gamerscore as i used to be (i used to have an 18,000 GS per year average... over the last 3 it's more like 500 or less haha).
 
Question for ozmodchips.....if i want to get the key from all different types of 360 dvd drive, what would be the best tool (s) for the job ? i know i can just use the xkey gecko for the drive in my slim but if i manage to install an xkey in my xbox easily enough, i have mates that would want me to do theirs, and i'd rather have the right tool(s) for the job right from the word go
 
i do have an early model slim, with the d4s drive....which is why i was going to use the gecko.....but i was hoping to find a solution so i can do different drives (except for the rgh ones....not touching them with a 10 foot pole).....so i'm guessing i'd have to grab a maximus lizard, or get the via pci sata card, and one of those sata-usb cables ?
 
Requesting some advice here. I have an XBOX 360 Arcade model which I got modded at a swap meet. It allows me to play back up games. The person pulled it apart, did some work and I came back after some time to see it completed.
 
The thing is, I want to get the new sports games and play online. Obviously i will purchase the new PES and FIFA, but can I take this modded console online? Will a dashboard update ruin the status of my XBOX?
 
The USB pro + Probe 3 will read the key from almost all drives
nothing can read the key from Hitachis in slims, and the dg16d5s in slims....which is everything made over september 2011
These consoles need RGH to get the keys.
 
I have soldered the NandX stuff, i am just left with doing the JTAG soldering. I misread the ozmodchips description and assumed it came with most of the stuff needed for JTAG, as i have found out, it does not.
