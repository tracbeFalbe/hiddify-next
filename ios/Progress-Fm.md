This attribute describes how much work the task indicated by the progress element requires. The max attribute, if present, must have a value greater than 0 and be a valid floating point number. The default value is 1.
 
This attribute specifies how much of the task that has been completed. It must be a valid floating point number between 0 and max, or between 0 and 1 if max is omitted. If there is no value attribute, the progress bar is indeterminate; this indicates that an activity is ongoing with no indication of how long it is expected to take.

**Note:** The :indeterminate pseudo-class can be used to match against indeterminate progress bars. To change the progress bar to indeterminate after giving it a value you must remove the value attribute with element.removeAttribute('value').
 
In most cases you should provide an accessible label when using . While you can use the standard ARIA labelling attributes aria-labelledby or aria-label as you would for any element with role="progressbar", when using you can alternatively use the element.
 
If the element is describing the loading progress of a section of a page, use aria-describedby to point to the status, and set aria-busy="true" on the section that is being updated, removing the aria-busy attribute when it has finished loading.

How would I know the progress of file upload in the dropbox folder? Cause I can see the progress in browser but how to see progress of the uploading file in the dropbox folder? I also dont wanna syn , I just want to upload the file and later delete those files from the folder when the process is done.

Moreover I wanna ask if the same process (hashing, zipping etc) is not initiated on browser then why I am still getting slow speed like 4.7 to 5 MBps approx? Almost all the files are aound 1.2GB to 2.5GB (no smaller files) and as you have suggested three factors
 
Generally speaking, your uploading speed to our servers when using a browser depends mainly on your ISP and local network settings unless there are other traffic restrictions. Having said that, it would be worth noting that uploading from your browser is slightly different than syncing content from your desktop.

I clicked "Upload Files" in my dropbox in Google Chrome on a Macbook Pro Retina, and so I am uploading a Logic Pro X file that's 47 GB that I need to share to my producer in a different state. My computer sounds like it is working on overdrive and my external hardrive (location of the file i chose to upload) is blinking like it's working, and the harddrive can't be ejected because "Google Chrome is using it". But I can't see anywhere what the status of the upload is, or how long it is estimated to take before it is done. Nor does the name of the file that's uploading appear anywhere. I've already tried finding the "menu bar" and nowhere in chrome do I have the option to make it viewable, nor is there a dropbox logo anywhere for me to click on.

So then I went through the whole process of downloading dropbox onto the computer, so now it does appear in my menu bar up top, but when i click on that, nowhere within does it show me the progress of this upload which is currently still making my computer work along with the hardrive that the file is coming from, nor is the name of the file i chose to upload visible anywhere. at the bottom of the dropdown is a little green checkmark that says "up to date" but when the mouse hovers on that it says "Pause synching" which to me makes no sense. If it's up to date, then what is it synching?

I've spent almost a half hour getting this stuff set-up to view the progress of the upload with no avail, and my computer is still loudly working in overdrive. It's a well-functioning Macbook Pro Retina for audio and video production with a solid-state external harddrive. 

I deleted and canceled my previous dropbox membership because uploads were taking days and that made no sense to me (I have great internet and don't have upload problems with anything else). The person i am working with prefers Dropbox, so i got it again. Why in the heck wouldn't the upload progress be directly in front of my face when an upload begins. The dropbox app doesnt even show that the file i chose to upload is uploading, not online, not when I look in the Finder window of the Macbook pro, clicking on the dropbox icon. This is extremely frustrating and my computer has been working on overdrive now for more than 30 minutes. I have no way to tell how long its going to be cranking unless I can find this information. I am confused why it's not automatically visible where I choose to upload it.


So now finally, the computer quit going crazy, the external harddrive quit blinking and is able to be ejected, but there's no file in my files, not in dropbox in Finder window, not in dropbox online. Where was it uploaded to? Literally nowhere is it found in my Dropbox
 
The desktop app syncs the data in your account with a local Dropbox folder on your computer that was created when you installed the app. To upload the file via the app, you can move this file into the Dropbox folder on your computer.

The Help file mentions, "The backup process does not interrupt your work or slow down the performance of ArcGIS Pro", but I would beg to differ as I am reoccurringly in a stalled state of not being able to select layers and other functionality and get frustrated and look up and sure enough [Backup in progress].
 
The next time this happens, go to your project's backup folder (ie C:\Path\To\Your\Project\.backup) and see what the size is. You have to do this when the project is actually alive and running and slow.
 
Also having this issue; more prevalent when working via VPN. ArcGIS Pro becomes unresponsive and even though the project is only 2.8 MB it is taking upward of 5 minutes to "backup." I set the backup interval to 10 minutes and 5 minutes are being used every time. This is bordering on the ridiculous. Current version 2.9.2; no other performance issues over internet/intranet.
 
I have the same issue in 2.9.1. I've been dealing with lags for a while in big projects, but I've only recently noticed the "Backup in Progress" message in the title bar. Since the backup essentially locks me out of the app while it's occurring, I think the backup frequency should be "x minutes from end of last backup" rather than "every x minutes"
