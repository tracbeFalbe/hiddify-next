Launched during the February Nintendo Direct as quite the surprise, plenty of players are no doubt stepping into the shoes of Samus all over again.
 
Before we get started on asking Nintendo for an entire Metroid Prime Trilogy remastered, let's get through Metroid Prime first. In this guide, we walk you through the first portion of the game, in which Samus is exploring a space station, and we're getting to grips with her capabilities. Without further ado, here's **how to escape the Space Station and beat the Parasite Queen in Metroid Prime Remastered**.

The trickiest part about this whole fight is maintaining a solid position, as the Parasite Queen is surrounded by a blue defensive shield with some gaps in it that will move. You need to fire through these gaps, specifically at the weak spot, while also dodging attacks. If you can keep yourself in position and continue to avoid attacks, this fight will pose you no trouble at all.
 
**Dark Souls: Remastered** holds a lot of secrets and navigating your way through Lordran safely can be a confounding nightmare. You might have run into two special status effects in your journey but have no idea how to deal with them. The Egg Parasites are something of a hidden status effect in the game, having no in-game description about what it is and does.
 
This is almost completely missable since you can only trigger it from a grab attack used by one enemy, yet it is required to further an NPC's questline. Curses, on the other hand, are more of a present threat; with the game telling you a lot about them and how to remove them.
 
After you ring the second Bell of Awakening in Blighttown, you will encounter a new enemy type in the Demon Ruins. These enemies have large egg sacks on their backs; some will be hostile, while others remain passive. **Known as Egg Carriers, these enemies have a unique function whereby they infect your character with a parasite**which will eventually cause a sizeable egg to erupt out of your neck and swallow your head.
 
While this is a way to unlock a merchant and get more dialogue from an NPC, it's still super gross. **The Egg Carriers have a special grab attack that will infect you if you get hit by it.**You'll know your character is infected because they will begin to scratch at their head while standing still. **Five minutes after being grabbed, an egg will appear on your head.**

**To remove the parasite and get your head back, you'll need an item called Egg Vermifuge**. You can find the Egg Vermifuge item as a drop from killing the Egg Carrier enemies outside Quelaag's Domain, but **the easiest way to obtain one is to find an NPC called Eingyi.**
 
**There is an illusory wall on the right-hand side of the room directly below where you ring the second Bell of Awakening**after beating Quelaag. Removing this wall will lead to a friendly NPC Egg Carrier called Eingyi, the Daughter of Chaos Bonfire, and the Covenant-related NPC Queelag's Sister.
 
**With the egg parasite on your head,**you'll be able to talk to Eingyi more; he will offer you an Egg Vermifuge for free, as well as allow you to buy an infinite number of them from him. **Using this item will remove the parasite completely.**
 
**While Cursed, you'll have your total HP reduced by 50 percent,** there will be a skull in the top-left corner of the screen where you'd usually see your Humanity counter, **you won't be able to reverse Hollowing or Kindle Bonfires,** and the Curse will persist even when you die and revive.
 
**The plus side to being Cursed is that you can hit ghost enemies**in New Londo Ruins without using the Transient Curse item. While this is convenient, considering **one of the two ways to remove the Curse status is in New Londo Ruins,** it's not the most effective way to do it. **The easiest way to remove Curse is to use the Purging Stone item.**
 
These can be purchased from **The Pardoner Oswald of Carim for 4,000 Souls.** He can be found at the bottom of the Bell Tower immediately after you defeat the Gargoyle bosses and ring the first Bell of Awakening.
 
**Purging Stones can also be bought from the female Undead Merchant found in the aqueduct connecting the Undead Burg to Firelink Shrine** for 6,000 Souls. The Purging Stone allows you to remove the Curse status, continuing on your pilgrimage as if nothing happened. They are single-use items and will disappear when used.
 
**There's an NPC found in the New Londo Ruins called Ingward that can remove your Curse status for one Humanity.** While this option is cheaper, it takes considerable effort to get to Ingward, making you clear half of New Londo Ruins. You have to fight through multiple ghost enemies that can be a massive pain to deal with since they float about and can hit you through walls.
 
**You can get to the New Londo Ruins by taking the lower elevator from Firelink Shrine.**Ingward can be found on top of a house in the upper part of New Londo. The building he's standing on is full of Ghost enemies, so you'll have to be careful to take them out one by one while using a Transient Curse or try to run past them.
 
**Once you reach Ingward and exhaust his dialogue, there will be an option to 'Have curse broken'.** Select this and you will be free from your curse for one Humanity. Ingward also has a lot of interesting things to say lore-wise, so make sure you have a long chat with him.
 
A recent trademark filing has led some people to wonder if Square Enix might finally be working on a **Parasite Eve** remake. After a releasing a series of remastered games, including a complete overhaul of Final Fantasy 7, the video game publisher had been mum about remaking its survival horror title, but fans of the game seem hopeful now.
 
First released in 1998 for the PS1, Parasite Eve was derived from Hideaki Sena's novel of the same name. It follows New York City police officer Aya Brea as she hunts down the deadly biological entity named Eve that's threatening to kill all life on Earth. At the time, the game redefined the survival horror genre because of its RPG-style approach to combat, making it one of Square's most popular PS1 games. It subsequently had two sequels: Parasite Eve II in 1999 and The 3rd Birthday in 2010.
 
Fast forward to October 13, when Square Enix filed a trademark for "Symbiogenesis," which was made public just recently. A quick dictionary search shows that symbiogenesis, also known as endosymbiotic theory, is when two organisms merge into one. It also happens to be the basis of Sena's Parasite Eve novel, where Eve is believed to be the product of this evolutionary theory.
 
As of writing, Square Enix has not confirmed anything about a possible Parasite Eve remake. This also isn't the first time the video game publisher has stirred up rumors of a Parasite Eve revival. In 2019, the company filed a trademark for the title Parasite Eve in the UK. However, there were no further updates on Square Enix's future projects involving the trademark.
 
Survival horror fans have been raring to see Parasite Eve get the Final Fantasy treatment for years. Considering how Square Enix managed to modernize the combat and RPG tactics of FF7, Parasite Eve may very well benefit from this. Of course, it would also be exciting to see the gruesome sci-fi elements in higher quality, such as when players are introduced to Eve for the first time.
 
Square Enix could also use this as an opportunity to introduce the franchise to players who didn't get to play Parasite Eve when it first launched. Although the first two games were made available on the Playstation Store in 2011, they were removed following Sony's decision to stop supporting older hardware. This makes it extremely difficult for old and new players to access the game, unless they had the game discs and their old PlayStation consoles. If Square Enix is looking for another franchise to revive in the near future, Parasite Eve is definitely a good one to bring back as a remake or reboot.
 
The script is based on a play Bong wrote in 2013. He later adapted it into a 15-page film draft, and Han split it into three different drafts. Bong said he was inspired by the 1960 Korean film *The Housemaid* and by the Christine and La Papin incident in the 1930s. Filming began in May 2018 and finished that September. The project included cinematographer Hong Kyung-pyo, film editor Yang Jin-mo, and composer Jung Jae-il.
 
*Parasite* premiered at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival on 21 May 2019, where it became the first Korean film to win its top prize, the Palme d'Or. It was released in South Korea by CJ Entertainment on 30 May, and was praised for Bong's direction and screenplay, and also for its editing, production design, and the performances of the cast. It grossed $262 million worldwide on a $11.4 million budget.
 
Among its numerous accolades, *Parasite* won the Academy Award for Best Picture at the 92nd Academy Awards, becoming the first non-English-language film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture.[note 1] It won an additional three Oscars, for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best International Feature Film. It is the first South Korean film to receive any Academy Award recognition, and one of only three films overall to win both the Palme d'Or and the Academy Award for Best Picture, the first such achievement in over 60 years.[note 2] It won the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film and the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language, and became the first non-English-language film to win the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. As of October 2022, a television series based
