If you see that the **upgrade-firmware** value is bigger than **current firmware**, you simply need to perform the **upgrade** command, accept it with **y** and then reboot with **/system reboot**
 
1. Press the Reset button and power on your device (wait until "USR" led is blinking then stable "On" and when the "USR" led is "Off" - release the Reset button) - the device is booting in **bootp**mode to reinstall RouterOS using Netinstall.  
2. Using the serial console, when the device is booting up, keep pressing **CTRL+E** on your keyboard until the device shows that it is **trying bootp protocol**  
3. Using the serial console, press any key while the device is booting and choose "o" then "1" and "x"

Which key will cause the BIOS to enter configuration mode during boot delay. Useful when the serial console prints out symbols during the boot process and goes into RouterBOOT menu by itself. Note that in some serial terminal programs, it is impossible to use the Delete key to enter the setup - in this case, it might be possible to do this with the Backspace key
 
Enables **preboot etherboot**, which runs before the regular boot device. It works the same as **boot-device=etherboot**, but has an additional timeout value. If an IP address is not received from the Netinstall server before the timeout expires, the regular booting process will start.
 
If the CPU or memory is overclocked and that is the reason why the router is not performing as suspected, then this is not considered a warranty case and you should return both frequencies to a nominal value.
 
**preboot-etherboot** is a feature that instructs RouterOS device to search for a Netinstall server on every boot for specified amount of time, before starting the regular booting process (e.g., RouterOS). This feature is particularly useful for remote reinstall, as it allows the device to attempt etherboot on every startup.
 
**preboot-etherboot-server**specifies that the **preboot-etherboot** booter should look only for a Netinstall server with a specific IP address. Since by default, etherboot accepts address from any BOOTP/DHCP server, with this feature, you can specify to accept the address only from a particular Netinstall server, meaning that the device can be reinstalled without removing it from the network.

With both features enabled, any device can be reinstalled remotely without accessing RouterOS or holding the reset button. One example of starting a remote reinstall process would be to simply power cycle RouterOS device from a PoE switch or another power controller. After installation, disable your Netinstall server and simply power cycle the installed device.
 
On every next reboot/power cycle, this device will try to receive IP address from Netinstall server with IP 10.155.115.199, for 9 seconds. If there will be no such server, regular boot process will start.
 
In case if the preboot-etherboot is set to boot from any IP (preboot-etherboot-server is not specified), the device will enter etherboot mode from any Netinstall/DHCP server-provided IP address and will wait for the reinstall process. Also, note that RouterOS reinstall does not affect BIOS settings, and preboot-etherboot would still be enabled and would try to enter etherboot. To avoid this scenario without accessing RouterOS, simply disable any attached Netinstall/DHCP server.
 
The feature allows the protection of RouterOS configuration and files from a physical attacker by disabling etherboot. It is called "Protected RouterBOOT". This feature can be enabled and disabled only from within RouterOS after login, i.e., there is no RouterBOOT setting to enable/disable this feature. These extra options appear only under certain conditions. When this setting is enabled - both the reset button and the reset pin-hole are disabled. RouterBOOT menu is also disabled. The only ability to change boot mode or enable the RouterBOOT settings menu is through RouterOS. If you do not know the RouterOS password - only a complete format is possible.
 
If you are already running RouterOS v6, upgrading to the latest version is simple. Just one click, and RouterOS will find the latest version, show you the changelog, and offer to upgrade. You can do this from Winbox, console, Webfig or QuickSet.
 
If you clicked on "Download" button then you will need to reboot router manually to complete installation, but if "download&Upgrade" was clicked then router will reboot automatically after files are downloaded.
 
Firmware can be upgraded/downgraded by selecting firmware file and pressing upgrade button. Switch will reboot automatically after successful upgrade. New firmware can be downloaded from our webpage:
 
Good afternoon.
There are several routers Mikrotik RB951UI-2HnD, flashed temporarily under the project firmware OpenWRT everything worked. I want to return the standard RouterOS firmware. I saved the keys.
I set it up according to the instructions. :Netinstall
What I tried:
 
Your only option is Netinstall.
I have had the same problem as you and I got it with the reset at the bottom of the router. Use a Phillips screwdriver so that the tip of the screwdriver goes slightly into the hole and makes a good connection.
Do not trust the times given by the manufacturer, in some cases I have been more than a minute, just wait for your router to be displayed in Netinstall.
 
Waiting doesn't help, I've waited longer, there's no point in doing that.as I see that the router is rebooting. I even pulled out the UTP cable, because the router is looking for a pxe server, as soon as I insert the cable, it immediately reboots. I can flash it with Tiny PXE server without any problems, but only under OpenWRT again. It turns out that the loader is working.
 
Connect the network cable to port 1.
Press reset, plug in, and keep pressing without releasing the reset button.
The ACT led turns on, then blinks for a few seconds, and then turns off.
In some instructions they say that we release the reset button at that moment, DO NOT DO IT !!!
We still have to keep pressing the reset button.
We will see that the led of port 1 will blink very fast, then it turns off for a moment, and then it turns on again, at that moment it should appear in the Netinstall window.
Now we can release the reset button, and start flashing.
 
I disabled firewall and antivirus. I installed a clean windows 10 32 bit, Windows 7, and even windows xp system for testing. Does not see Mikrotik. I have another Mikrotik model (Map lite) with RouterOS. I can see it in netinstall without any problems. Now I have installed OpenWRT specifically on MAp lite for testing. I see it in netinstall. The problem is with RB951UI-2HnD
 
Turn off the power to the router Press the Reset button And connect the power to the router
Watch the LED that shows the activity of the device (usually ACT or USR). First, it lights up, then flashes, then lights up again, then will turn off. After 5 seconds, the router will beep.
Release the Reset button
 
Launch the Serva app.
Set the address 192.168.1.10 on the computer's Ethernet adapter using standard operating system tools.
Run Serva32.exe. If a Firewall message appears that the application is blocked, allow it access to all networks by checking the appropriate boxes in the pop-up window.
 
Connect to the Ethernet connector 1. Restart the router on the power supply.
After these actions, the router will boot with the standard version of OpenWRT in RAM. This may take up to 3 minutes. The router will notify you of the download with an audible signal.
 
After loading OpenWRT in RAM, in the case of firmware of a router with several Ethernet connectors, you need to reconnect the computer to connector 2. If the router has one Ethernet connector, you do not need to switch anything.
 
The process may take several minutes. Wait for the router to restart. After that, the firmware process is complete. Now connect the cable to the second port. ON the network adapter, set receive address automatically. The adapter should get an address like 192.168.13. xx
 
Hi
Put static IP on Lan port
See if you have other network cards enabled, even wifi -> disable it all
Then put RJ45 cable on first port (wan)
Open NetInstall and configure NetBooting with an IP next to your LAN port IP
After boot the device with reset pressed
Release the reset after devices shows on NetBooting
Now you can install your original firmware
 
I had this exact problem and fixed the issue by using an older version of the netinstall tool that supports **BOOTP** rather than just **DHCP**.
When I was running wireshark I noticed I was seeing bootp requests with no response. When I downgraded to netinstall 6.32
 -6.32.3.zip
Netinstall responded to the bootp request and I could flash on the older version of RouterOS then upgrade to the latest. The setting for bootp vs dhcp is under the RouterBOARD -> Settings and make sure the Boot Protocol is set to dhcp:

 
I have a brand new MikroTik router that behaves strangely out of the box (came with RouterOS version 7.11, upgraded to 7.14.1, default admin account disabled) - even when its configuration is completely reset, it sends out SYN packets to random IP addresses on the Internet (yes, the packets are going through the output chain, not input). Either I don't understand something (which is possible) or the router has some malware on it. So at this point I have two questions:
 
I bought more than 100 mikrotik devices and see this problem just 2 times (and I have no reason for it)!if you have reset your router (as you said), Connect directly via LAN and to the first port.open winbox and use your device information
