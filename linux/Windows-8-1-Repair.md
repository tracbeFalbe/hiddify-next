Hi, my prusaslicer auto-repair tool doesnt work. I have the 2.7.1 version installed. But it didnt worked with ver. 2.6.0 either. The progess bar go to 50% then it just hung there and never finish the repair.
 
The repair tool works just fine with my PS 2.7.1. Have you tried it with a simple object? If you have some very challenging mesh, or a very complex mesh with millions of faces the auto-repair tool can take a very long time and during that time it will look as if it permanently froze. But it isn't. I have had some auto-repairs which took a whole night to complete and while doing so looked frozen until it is done.
 
It can help a lot if you use the "simplify model" tool before, just reduce the mesh to whatever the "Detail level high" setting suggests and check if you lost any significant details. If you lost something you can use a milder reduction by using the reduction by percent option. If the simplified model looks fine, proceed with the auto-repair tool. It should be a lot faster then.
 
It happen with every broken object i try to repair. And in the window repair, the progress bar goes only 50% and freeze there. And the text inside that window say "Item repaired by windows repair algorithms"
 
Indeed. PS is quite good at getting printable g-code out of almost any mesh, no matter how broken the meshes are you throw at it. However, not always. Sometimes there are issues with missing layers or even entire volumes.

I've just upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 on my partitioned laptop that has Ubuntu 14.04 installed. Grub no longer appeared on boot so I ran boot-repair from an Ubuntu liveUSB. This didn't seem to have any effect. I've checked and secure boot is still disabled.
Log from boot-repair: 
So what's next?

Update: I've attempted to use chroot to update grub from my Ubuntu partition. update-grub runs successfully finding both linux and windows boot manager but the process still doesn't have any effect. grub-install complains that it cannot find EFI directory (but I have mounted everything correctly).

Update2: Just discovered that running efibootmgr after chroot into ubuntu shows ubuntu as not being in the boot order at all. I manually changed the order and rebooted to discover that the bootorder was reset. I run in windows: bcdedit /set bootmgr path \EFI\ubuntu\shimx64.efi But this has no effect either even after reporting 'Operation Successful'.
 
As pointed out in the comments (by David Faure), the final argument to this command depends on your particular system configuration. You can use this command to determine the correct path for your system:
 
My wife's machine is older (non-UEFI) and had Ubuntu installed on a logical extended partition. Upgrading to Windows 10 first killed grub so reboots resulted in the "grub rescue" prompt, which I restored with BootRepair from LiveUSB, but my Linux partition was missing! I restored this with parted rescue from LiveUSB, which found and recovered the partition. From there, I mounted the partition from LiveUSB and did a grub-install and was able to boot back into the recovered Ubuntu and Win10. Hope this helps others.
 
We have a number of answers here providing steps on how they fixed the issue (Loss of Grub menu due to latest Win10 update). Various answers proves the solution isn't unique as the machine configs ain't unique.
 
Basically, at some point in the upgrade, I ended up with grub going into rescue mode because my debian partition had been wiped in the process and hence the boot files with it (I generally have a separate boot partition but not this time ...). From a look at this link: Windows 10 upgrade led to grub rescue
 
Anyhow, I fixed the problem by booting on a Win8.1 install external hdd and followed those instructions: -mbr/ (scroll down to win8/8.1). That wiped grub and reinstalled mSoft's boot loader. I then managed to finish the upgrade and reinstalled debian all together since at the time I had not realised it was simply a problem with the partition table not being written correctly. Yet a better solution would be to try and recover your partition table (using testdisk?) and then reinstall/update grub.
 
I used the rescuetux/supergrubdisk. Booted it from DriveDroid on my android tablet. Then used auto detect rescuetux. Went into the WINDOWS button, hit the betaWindowsMBR repair button. And selected /dev/sda2 ok ok ok. Then it said successful. Now i just booted back into windows uefi menu.
 
If you have a Win10 installation media you may use this to install a new fresh MBR. Just boot intil you see "Install now" (or similar) but do not click on it. There is a small link saying "repair tools" (or something). From this you may enter command prompt.
 
This should fix the issue. But, Your Linux is longe gone due to Microsofts ignorance to peoples own choices. They have just decided that it is okay for them to delete whatever is available on your HDD and which they do not like. Therefor we may legally decide that MS is a bunch of dorks...
 
8/8/15 I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10, and after Windows10 installed I made Firefox my default browser and shut down my PC, waited 15 seconds and powered up the PC and didn't even expect that it would give me an option to still choose Ubuntu within 5 seconds.I clicked Ubuntu and it seemed to hang in limbo with a grey screen for what seemed an eternity , but I didn't do anything except tapped the enter button on the keyboard to attempt get something to happen and waited , then finally the familiar black screen to choose Ubuntu or advanced options appeared. It booted up in Ubuntu fine. After I shut off and powered up in windows 10, the time and date in Windows showed 5 hours fast, just like windows 7 did after using Ubuntu, LOL. Next time I chose Ubuntu to boot the boot up wait was a lot shorter.
 
For me the process was quite complicated. I use boot repair form the usb stick, and after I remove the usb stick and restart the computer only ubuntu login option came. I log into Ubuntu which was installed in my computer hard disk and then use boot repair again. After that when I restart my computer now I have the options to login into both Unbunt and winsows 10 and it's working just fine.
 
After not using my computer for a while (turned off) I booted it back up to windows through boot camp. After I left the computer overnight, taking into mind there was a scheduled update for windows. I came back to use it and windows seemed to not be working anymore. When windows is booted up it goes to windows repair. I ran CHKDSK using the CMD Prompt and majority of the partitions cannot be read so I canceled because of how long it was taking. When I went onto the OS X side, the windows is still readable, files can be accessed etc. However in the disk utility info option the boot camp partition says that it is unbootable (by saying no) the rest of the values also say no. What do I need to do to fix this issue? Without data being lost.
 
In your specific case, it seems to be corruption within NTFS. Power outages or crashes can leave NTFS corrupt, which is typically checked when you boot Windows the next time. Partial Driver updates or Windows Updates can also cause this issue. I will normally only apply Security Updates manually.
 
I currently have the Windows 8 installer on a flash drive and tried using the Automatic Repair option to repair the bootloader but it didn't do anything. The Startup Repair option is also missing in the Windows 8 installer.
 
Firstly, boot from a UEFI Windows 8 recovery disk (CD/DVD/USB) - I found that the automated recovery process didn't find the correct Windows partition, nor when I managed to add it to BCD settings would it make it reliably bootable e.g. using BCDEDIT I got it to find and launch the Windows partition but it refused to cold boot or would not "keep" the settings after a 2nd reboot or power off.
 
I had a 1.5 TB hard drive with Windows 7 installed on it. I then installed Windows 8 onto a 150 GB SSD I bought. The 1.5 TB hard drive failed and I could hear it making a noise, my computer would no longer start, saying "please insert system disk". I thought that the bootloader was missing as it must have been on the 1.5 TB disk. It turns out it was but the problem then was the guides I followed would not rebuild the bootloader or whatever it is called as i did not have an EFI partition on the smaller 150 GB disk (this may have existed on the failed disk), it only had 1 partition which filled the entire disk.
 
I did not want to lose all my data so I entered the Command Prompt by booting from my Windows 8 install USB drive (noting that you cannot boot the UEFI version of this if that appears, select to boot from the just the USB drive without the UEFI appearing before it).
 
These commands will create the EFI partition. Double-check everything by typing list vol. You should see a 200 MB partition. You now ne
