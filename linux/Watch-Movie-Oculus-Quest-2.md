Mods can go ahead and delete/lock this thread...i found a workaround for it...problem was i dont have (and dont plan to have) a PC so i couldnt just plug it in and transfer but i just used my xbox to upload from the external drive the videos where on, downloaded them on to my tablet from there, reformatted them, then uploaded to google from tablet and downloaded them on to the headset from there...took a bit of time but it works

Setting up the Dropbox app on a virtual machine or desktop or sync virtual machine program files could work however, we cannot really indicate whether it would work fully as expected, considering each third party VR software, may have unexpected configurations.

Yes me too i have the same problem. It appeared after the last Oculus Quest Update V12.
So it is an Oculus Problem and there are People already posting in the Oculus comunity support section. I hope Oculus will see it and can fix it soon, because Dropbox is one of the few ways to easily transfer files..(in my case 3D stereoscopic Pictures and Videos) to this device and into the Oculus Gallery.
 
One of the best all-in-one and flexible ways to watch movies and TV on Oculus Quest 2 is Bigscreen, an app that lets you sit in cinema-focused environments and watch content on the big screen, hence the name.
 
First and foremost, Bigscreen has a library of **on-demand movies**available for rent, including some 3D movies. You can see these by going to the Movies tab in the main menu, where you can rent any of the movies available.
 
Bigscreen also has public rooms that constantly stream free TV shows and movies, similar to free-to-air TV channels. There are channels dedicated specifically to one show, like the Classic Doctor Who and Rick & Morty channels, along with ones that focus on a particular genre of movie or TV show.

Not to be confused with the Quest app of the same name, Bigscreen also has virtual desktop functionality. This will allow you to stream a view of your desktop PC to Bigscreen, which you can use this to watch local video files from your PC in Bigscreen by pulling them up on Windows Media Player, VLC or a similar app.
 
Certain streaming services offer native VR apps you can use on Quest headsets, such as Netflix (as detailed above) and Prime Video VR. However, others like Disney+ and Hulu do not have native VR apps available on Quest at the moment.
 
However, it is possible to watch some streaming content using Oculus Browser, just like you would on a computer. This may depend on compatibility of the streaming service in question, but we were able to get Disney+ working just fine and most others should work too. You can simply log in to the service via Oculus Browser and then either watch windowed in your home environment, or go full screen to block out all distractions.
