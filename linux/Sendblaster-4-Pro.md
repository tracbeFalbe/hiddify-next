SendBlaster is an email software that provides bulk email solutions to manage mailing lists and set up email marketing campaigns. It provides templates for writing emails and newsletters as well as analytics for you to track your email campaigns.
 
Today, most email marketing software is hosted in the cloud. In fact, at SocketLabs we even built our our own email marketing tools, which are a great sendblaster alternative. Unlike most cloud-based email platforms like SocketLabs, Sendblaster is downloaded right to your computer.

Your money is worth the investment for a cloud-based server. Using a open source SMTP server is more time consuming as you have to build and maintain your email infrastructure. This may also be more costly.
 
I'm putting together an eblast via sendblaster where I have a qualified list of email addresses; in the email copy is a link to a web page to look at a listing of products (on a web page) with a button to request bulk pricing. onclick I need the checked items and the email address of the person who filled in the form to be emailed back to a given email address including the user's email address (using php mail function for this). How do I pull the user's email address from sendblaster (or an IP address) and auto-fill it in the form?
