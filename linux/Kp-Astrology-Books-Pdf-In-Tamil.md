Spring, Elizabeth
 **North Node Astrology: Rediscovering Your Life Direction and Soul Purpose 
** This book does a fine job of exploring the lunar nodes and also provides a solid introduction to the outer planets. Elizabeth is a very fine writer too, which is a curiously rare quality among astrologers. She brings a very personal perspective to bear on the symbolism, generalizing effectively from her own experience to the broader principles which apply to everyone. Truth in advertising: Elizabeth has studied with me (SF) in my apprenticeship program. She is my favorite kind of student -- one who respectfully internalizes what I teach, and who then goes on to find her own voice.

Any film involving reporters has to include a scene in the newspaper archives, right? This almost obligatory scene, lasting only a minute, occurs a little over an hour into the film. Avery takes Graysmith to the newspaper archives, looking for copies of the Modesto Bee. (Yep, a real newspaper, founded in 1884. Of course I had to look that up, too!) They gather clues from newspaper clippings to suggest that some killings the Zodiac killer confessed to are in doubt, because he only provides clues in letters written after articles in the newspaper came out.
 
Graysmith continues to track down clues about the Zodiac killer, even when others have given up. At 1 hour and 44 minutes into the film, Graysmith visits Avery, who has left (been fired? or otherwise forced out?) from his job as a reporter and is living in a trailer. Avery challenges why Graysmith is even continuing down the Zodiac path.
 
This next scene, between Graysmith and Inspector Toschi, feels like a companion piece to the first scene I mentioned between Graysmith and Avery; this scene takes place in a diner while the earlier scene occurred in a bar. Both involve library books.
 
At two hours into the film, in a scene lasting fewer than 30 seconds, we see Avery drinking again, this time in a bar. (Progress?) The TV is on, and he looks up as a news reporter mentions the Zodiac killer. The reporter is interviewing Graysmith.
 
There are 7 scenes total in this Class V film that mention libraries or library books or otherwise take place in an archives or library setting. The duration of those scenes last for a combined 12-15 minutes (only 10% out of a 157-minute running time!), but the combined scenes and library books leave a lasting impression.
 
Just as it is with cookery books: there are astrology books that you read once and ones that you return to again and again, and those that you use just occasionally for a single recipe. Much depends on the quality of the writing, because some of these books, although filled with useful information, are just a chore to get through, and some are a good read in their own right.
 
Then you also find that an astrologer who has brilliant insight into say, the Moon, seems to have no understanding of Saturn or Capricorn; or someone who is marvellous at interpreting horary charts cannot understand even basic psychology. So you do need to read every book critically. The more you read, of course, the easier it is to make your own judgments.
 
Throughout centuries, astrology has been used to help us understand ourselves better. Astrologers look towards the planets and cosmos to gain key insights about a person, including their personality traits, interests, and even hardships based on their birth chart (a map of what was happening in the sky when we were born)
 
This knowledge can be extremely validating, making sense of emotions or tendencies that may otherwise feel confusing to us. Astrological readings can even help us make big career decisions or learn what kinds of relationships fulfill us the most.
 
For example, the book addresses seemingly counterintuitive parts of astrology, like why horoscopes show southern planets above the horizon and northern planets below. "Thanks to April, I can now explain it in a few pithy sentences to a befuddled student," adds Grace.
