We came for a work team building activity and it was lots of fun! The staff was super helpful and encouraging, especially when some of us got a little nervous about the height. It's also a bit of a workout as I was sore the next day. I would definitely recommend checking it out!
 
I visited with my family and coworkers and we all had a blast. Most of my coworkers had no experience with this type of activity and we are afraid of heights but we did it any ways. The place is very easy to get to, only an hour from Houston. Checking in was very easy as I only had to say my name but we had to sign the waivers online. There are employees everywhere if you need them enforcing their rules that are ultimately there to keep you safe. First impression I thought the place was kind of small but 3 hours was enough time to get around and try most if not all the different courses. I never felt rushed, You can do the different courses at your own pace but you still need to be respectful of others.Not only I would do it again but I also recommend it.
 
This was the most incredible experience. The staff were so friendly and helpful, and the actual aerial course was a blast!! It was a wonderful opportunity for us to enjoy something as a family while still allowing us to take part at our own levels. Definitely give this a try!
 
We believed them when they said, "Check in 20 min ahead of your climb time." There's a fair amount of gear and some training that takes place before you begin. Efficient, knowledgeable, helpful. Great fun for the cousins to do together!
 
This was my first time doing a ropes course. Upon check in we were geeked by polite and professional staff. The ground school instructor was knowledgeable and patient. Upon beginning the course all of the staff were hands on, there w the customers every step of the way. There are 3 levels with multiple staff members on each level. I felt safe at all times and would highly recommend this business and facility. They were all professional, knowledge, and accommodating.
 
Amazing experience... the 3 hours consists of check in, safety brief, and have fun. There is cold water available for free. Highly recommend you bring gloves or purchase them on site for $10. It is definitely a workout. It was hot, please consider going early in the day to avoid the heat in the middle of the day.
 
Loved it!! Great for guests visiting H-Town. Amazing upper body workout (went two days ago & still sore). Highly recommend for people looking to get over a fear of heights. Easy parking, well-maintained equipment...you haven't lived 'til you've jumped off a ledge with the TruBlue belay!
 
The staff was very educated, humble and assisted in any questions or a possible scenario during the course. Towards the end of the course, I highly recommend facing your fear of heights and JUMP! Trust me, you will not regret it! If you need some encouragement, they are there to do just that. Highly recommend!
 
Never reviewed before but I loved this place. The trees gave us good shade while climbing. Be sure to read the requirements and policies. No phones were allowed, so no pictures, but was a great place to unplug. A must-do on your Texas bucket list!
 
Every summer, my grandma and grandpa take my brother and I on some sort of vacation, road trip, or adventure and this year. One of the things we did this year is head to Lake Tahoe for a couple days, where we visited Eagle Falls, hiked down to Vikingsholm Castle in Emerald Bay, and did the Granlibakken ropes course at the Tahoe Treetop Adventure Park.
 
My favorite part about the Tahoe Treetop Ropes Course were all the zip lines. I was pretty scared at first to just jump off the platform with nothing but a rope, but each time I did it, it got more and more fun. I even did one of the long zip lines upside down!
