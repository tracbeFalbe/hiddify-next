Theoretically, a guide giving the code doesn't need anything except the numbers. It would be the shortest guide ever, but also would be rather unhelpful. Part of what makes Resident Evil Village such a complex game isn't the "what." It's also the "where," "how," and "when." These are all important pieces in unlocking doors, finding secret areas, and, yes, using combinations.
 
The workshop isn't accessible right away and it can take players some time to find it. That's when the developers decided to get a little bit sneaky and hide the code in plain sight, so long as the viewer is looking at it all from the correct direction. It's good to applaud new ideas in a genre of gaming that desperately needs ideas besides weirder and weirder zombie shapes.

The entrance to the workshop is clearly labeled in the village on the map, but it's not immediately apparent how to get in there. Many of these squares are available by rooftop or tunnels inside of neighboring homes. Many pro gamers have a tough time getting in because they see a lock with no key and a red "DO NOT ENTER" sign.
 
Many times, these two hints are indicators that players aren't permitted to enter that area yet. Not this time! **The lock on the door can be broken simply by stabbing it or shooting at it**.
 
**The workshop is on the left side when entering this area**. It's also easy to miss because it has seen better days and has clearly been out of commission for longer than the outbreak has been in effect for. The workshop itself is a smaller building than the storage shed it has on the right.
 
Upon entering the workshop, there is a seemingly innocent piece of paper with a picture on it on a table directly in front of Ethan. Pick it up and flip it over. The message reads "Look out the window."
 
It's very important to take this advice literally. Many gamers are getting hung up at this point because they'll walk outside and find two numbers. But the code can only be gathered fully and in order from the inside while looking outside.
 
When first looking outside, a zombie is scripted to pop up and attack. **The door is wide open, so deal with this attack before finding the code** and opening up the cabinet on the left.

With the threat out of the way, look out the window. On the red brick wall to the left, there's an "07." In the middle, painted with yellow on the window itself, is an "04." And then a grey tarp on the right has an "08." Put them together and **the code is 070408**.
 
There is an item in here that Ethan will need to lift up the jack on a tractor blocking the way forward in a few moments. But, more importantly, there is an M1911 handgun here as well. Those who are sick of the weakness from the default pistol will want to try giving this a shot as many experts find it is a significant upgrade.
 
Resident Evil, as a series, has always featured secret codes and safes for players to find. In most cases, these codes grant players access to upgrades and valuable treasures. While the same can be said for Resident Evil Village, the series; most recent installment, players will need to find these codes to progress the game. Here is every door and safe code in Resident Evil Village, along with their rewards.
 
Capcom has issued a patch for the Resident Evil 4 remake, which includes a handful of bug fixes, as well as the removal of a popular speedrun glitch. The glitch previously allowed players to warp through doors, leading to some incredibly fast completion times in the remake.
 
Known as the Scope Glitch, players could continuously aim down the sights of a scoped weapon while standing behind a locked door to clip through it, removing the need to find keys or alternate routes. The glitch was a bit finicky to perform, but expert speedrunners were able to consistently clip through locked doors, allowing players to skip boss fights and other sections of the game.
 
The replay quotient of the Resident Evil 4 remake is already incredibly high. Aside from attempting the game on higher difficulties, odds are you will miss at least some of the collectibles or guns during your first run. Still, many people will want more, and the included extras like costumes and special weapons can only extend a single-player game's life so much. This is where mods come in. From new models and outfits to reworked mechanics, mods can breathe new life into this survival horror masterpiece.
How to install Resident Evil 4 remake mods
Modding for the Resident Evil 4 remake is only really available for the PC version, and is most easily done through the popular Nexus Mod Manager. This safe, reliable tool allows you to browse, download, and apply mods with ease. After you download the manager, you simply need to save the mod of your choice, run the installer, go through the installation, and run the game with the mod. For a more detailed tutorial on how to do this, see the Nexus Mods tutorial or watch the video below.
 
The fact that Resident Evil 4 remake retains the original's ability to mix horror with campy fun is one of its greatest aspects. One moment you will be gripping your controller for dear life as a swarm of bloodthirsty villagers relentlessly pursue you, and the next Leon's making quips and performing suplexes. There was one small fun diversion in the original game that has been expanded and improved for the remake, which is the optional Shooting Gallery. This time there are multiple of these safe spaces to hone your aim, but also a fully developed system of challenges, scores, and, best of all, rewards. If you want to take a breather from all the horrors that await you in Resident Evil 4 remake, here's where you can find all the Shooting Galleries, what you can win, and some helpful tips.
Shooting Gallery locations
 
There are a total of five locations across all 16 Chapters of Resident Evil 4 remake, and they all are within the safety of a Merchant zone. Each one, except the last, will introduce a new set of three challenges, but all previous challenges from past Shooting Galleries will be present in the later ones. That means you could technically wait and only visit the final one to take on all the challenges there. Here's where you can find each individual Shooting Gallery in order of appearance:

Cryptic puzzles and secret caches of goodies have long been a staple in the Resident Evil franchise, and Resident Evil Village is no exception. As you navigate Ethan Winters through the hostile environments of the game, you'll come across a series of padlocks that require six-digit codes. Here are the solutions to every lock combination in Resident Evil Village.
 
After leaving the castle and talking to Duke about your next objective, you'll be tasked with tracking down a house in the village **with a red chimney**. Unfortunately, the path to this building is blocked by a small tractor. A small way up the hill from this obstruction will be the **village workshop** where you'll find the tool needed to lift this tractor. Unfortunately, it's locked in a cabinet that requires a six-digit code. On one of the workbenches in this building **you'll find a photograph** with the text "look outside" written on the back. Here you'll find the three sets of numbers needed to open the cabinet and grab the lift handle. Be prepared for a good ol' fashioned jump scare as you're looking out the window though.
 
Our next lock combination appears in the haunting halls of **House Beneviento**. After you've encountered Donna and had all of your weapons stripped away, you'll need to examine the Mia mannequin on the operating table in the center of this room. On the left hand of this mannequin **you'll find a bloody wedding ring**. Examine the hand and remove the ring. On the opposite shoulder you'll find a **silver key** hidden in a removeable compartment. Grab this key and make your way to room across from the mannequin's head to **clean the wedding ring** in the sink. Engraved on the inside of the ring will be the code needed for this lock combination.
 
The final lock combination in Resident Evil Village is also the only optional one in the game. When you were exploring the village searching for the red chimney, you may have come across a house that was locked with a distinctive **violin shaped symbol** next to the door. As you're leaving House Beneviento, you'll find the **key with a violin hanging off it** needed to unlock this building on the table of a structure on top of a hill on the left where you'll find a typewriter and the ball puzzle for this area. Grab this key and make your way back to the locked house. In the back corner of this building you'll find a locked cabinet. The solution for this combination **is on a child's drawing** hanging on the wall of the kitchen as you first enter.
 
Resident Evil Village is out now for Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, PC, and Stadia. If you're looking to maximize the horror, you'll want a good pair of headphones or a headset, so check out our list of the best Xbox Series X, Series S headsets.
