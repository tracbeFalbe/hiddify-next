Try trying one by one. If your systems has 2 memory slots remove the top ram stick then try to power on. If no luck then swap the 2nd slot with the one you removed. You may only have one port if so remove the ram and the hard drive and see if it will power on if it does you should recieve a beep. If not try putting the ram in first - power on. Then try just the hd - power on.

Hi, I had this problem just this morning with my Acer Aspire E1-572G: battery and power lights both on, memory light flickering. I tried all the online solutions - battery in, battery out, power button holding, plug, unplug, hold battery and dance in a circle singing ABBA - to no avail.

I then decided to leave it sitting for awhile in the 'on' state, let it sit on the naughty step and think about what it'd done, and after about 20 minutes ignoring it (brushed my teeth, did the washing up, read a book) it booted up all on it's own. No idea why. I'm not a techie. Maybe an update or something?
 
On the back of the laptop see if you can locate a pinhole usually it has a small symbol beside it. This contains a switch that would disconnect the small bios battery press and hold for 60 seconds with a small paperclip with the battery and power disconnected. Proceed to press the power button a few times before connecting battery or power supply. Boot without battery until you can get into your operating system . After this computer boots and everything is working then you can install the battery while the system is on to see if the battery will start to charge.
