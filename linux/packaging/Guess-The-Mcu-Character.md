Thank you for sharing these! I used them for a shadow puppet theater program and the kids loved making stories with their favorite characters. Luckily, the laminating kept them in pretty good condition, so now they can be used for a display like you intended ?

The elementary librarian I volunteer with and I are going to use them in the library windows at the beginning of the year. This is the newest elementary school in our district with children from several different schools. We thought this could generate great discussions for meeting the students and finding out who their favorite book characters are.
 
Hi! We're Dana and Lindsey, two children's librarians ready to take on storytime. Jbrary is a library of storytime resources for those of us working with children. Join us for songs, rhymes, fingerplays, and more!

*Akinator* is the web genie; a custom made bot that essentially plays '20 Questions' with you and tries to guess what character, real or fictional, past or present, that you're thinking of. The algorithm they use is an original creation.
 
Maybe you've heard of it this silly website, maybe you haven't. It was news to me when James Brady of Niners Nation used it to try and guess 49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh. So I decided to do the same thing and see if *Akinator*could guess Saints quarterback Drew Brees.
 
With Drew in mind, I clicked "Play" and took *Akinator* for a little spin around the block. The way it works is that *Akinator* will ask questions and eliminate people from its database based on answers given. A person can answer **Yes, No, Don't Know, Probably** and **Probably Not** . After enough questions, it's hopefully able to correctly narrow down the database to one character.
 
Good starting question. Makes sense, as the answer will quickly eliminate a large chunk the database. But do any of us really exist? I can't prove it or give an answer with absolute certainty. I could really throw off *Akinator* by answering **Probably Not.** But Descartes believed *cogito ergo sum* so we'll just go with that and answer...**Yes** .
 
*Akinator* has no problems with racial profiling, we've now established that. But it's another question that will eliminate a lot of potential answers. As far as I know, Drew is not black...**No.**
 
Tough question. On the one hand, Drew *was* a member of One Direction. On the other hand, he has absolutely zero musical talent and his singing is physically painful to hear. Sorry, Drew. I love you but it's true. I'm gonna go with...**No**.
 
Oh man, *Akinator* is totally on to us. It's only a matter of time at this point. Funny how he immediately made the jump to NFL after asking about a team sport. He could have said MLB, NHL, NBA, but he went with NFL. *Akinator* knows what's up...**Yes**.
 
Yeah, on the right side of his face. That's incredible. How the hell did *Akinator* know that? Something tells me that's not *really* what he's asking. My guess is that he's referring to team colors and that this is really a poorly worded question. Gotta be. So I'll say...**No**.
 
Awww crap, did I answer the earlier "patriot" question wrong? I really don't understand this question. This eliminates, like, one guy. There are a lot of other better questions to be asking here...**No**.
 
Call me crazy but it seems like this question should have been asked a long time ago, like after the NFL question but before the religious movement or funny haircut questions. *Akinator* has got to be getting close at this point...**Yes**.
 
Should this be enough or would it be better to change towards a longer password. How long should it be? Recently viewing the results with GPU cracking I got a little worried. The thing is that I don't want to choose a password so long so that I'd forget it and get locked out.
 
This corresponds to a 66 bit password, protected with plain SHA256. TrueCrypt uses PBKDF2 with 1000 iterations, which gives us a factor 2000 bonus, so we can subtract 11 bits, and we arrive at 55 bits.
 
A completely random password of length 15 chosen from 37 different characters has an entropy of 78 bits, and thus is safely out of range for graphics card based attacks. Note that this only applies if the password is completely random. If it has some exploitable structure, such as words or keyboard patterns, the entropy might be considerably lower.
 
In short, LUKS uses PBKDF2 to derive your encryption key from your keyboard. This process applies a salt to make generating a generic rainbow table difficult and is also slow to compute when deriving keys, making each check relatively expensive.
 
A 15-character password should, therefore, be fine. PBKDF2 is designed to protect such passwords. That said - I would always advice varying character classes (use uppercase, punctuation, numerical digits too) if you can - anything that increases the entropy and length of the password is a Good Thing.
 
Remember, I'm a fictional character from one of your favorite TV shows/movies and you can only ask me yes/no questions. *But be forewarned, I will sometimes try to trick you, and other times, I might even forget who I am!*
 
I recently saw a video by Mark Rober online claiming to have a best Guess Who? strategy and so being a mathematician I wanted to check the numbers. In this blog we will consider what constitutes a good question and whether Rober really does have an optimal strategy.
 
Any question will split the remaining candidates into two groups. Since each candidate that has yet to be ruled out is equally likely, we can consider any two questions equivalent if the smaller of the groups they each identify contain the same number of candidates.
 
Suppose we have n candidates remaining. Since we are asking a question, we must have that n is greater than 1 and since we can automatically rule out our own character we also know that n can be at most 23.
 
We can now define a question by the size of the smaller of the two groups that it splits the candidates into. We will call this number m. If m=0 the question is giving us no new information and therefore does not help us. We will therefore assume m is at least 1. Since m is the size of the smaller group it is at most n/2 or (n-1)/2 if n is odd. Note that such a question will always exist since for any candidate we can ask if their character name comes before them alphabetically.
 
The best choice becomes clear if we consider the extreme cases. Ifm=1 we could get the correct solution straight away but this will only happen 1in every 23 tries. The rest of the time we will only rule out one candidate. Ifwe proceed to guess one candidate each time it will take us on average 11.5guesses. On the other hand if we take m to be as big as possible we will ruleout at least 11 candidates so it will take at most 5 guesses.
 
Similarly if we suppose our opponent went first and their firstquestion rules out all but two candidates, they are then guaranteed to win ontheir next question. With our current strategy it is impossible for us to winin two moves and so in this situation it might be better to play moreaggressively by asking a question with a smaller m.
 
Our choice of move could also depend on how we weight draws verseswins. If we want to win outright thenour only option is to make a guess. If we would rather win but are happy with adraw we need to make some calculations. Again we will only consider the twoextreme cases:
 
Therefore, it is always better to make guesses in this situation. This highlights that although the Guess Who? strategy described by Rober is very good in most situations if we take the other players actions into account it is not optimal.

Guess Who Multiplayer? is an online game similar to the popular 1980s board game. You get a character, as do your opponents, and each player is tasked with guessing each other's characters based on the answers to various questions about physical traits.
 
Guess Who? brings the classic board game everyone loves to the digital realm! Each player has a character, and the opposing player must guess who they are. Choose from a variety of different questions and answer truthfully. Guess Who? can be played online and against the computer.How to Play Guess Who?Play online or soloSelect whether you want to play online or against the computer. If you play online, you'll be prompted to provide a nickname, and then you can play multiplayer. Your goal, in either case, is to guess who your opponent is before they guess who you are!
 
To narrow down the possible characters, the game gives you a selection of questions. You must choose which question to ask on your turn. If you ask a good question, it will reduce the number of faces on the board. Look at the faces available and try to select the question that will help you narrow the selection down most quickly to be a savvy detective!
