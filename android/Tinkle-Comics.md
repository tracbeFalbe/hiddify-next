It is published in English and syndicated in many Indian languages like Hindi, Bengali, and Malayalam.
 
Anant Pai, the founding editor of the magazine, is known to his readers as Uncle Pai. The idea behind starting a comic book series devoted to Indian culture and history came to Pai from a quiz contest aired on Doordarshan in February 1967, in which participants could easily answer questions pertaining to Greek mythology, but were unable to reply to the question "In the Ramayana, who was Rama's mother?"

Pai left his job at Times of India, and started ACK (Amar Chitra Katha) the same year, with the help of late **G.L. Mirchandani** of IBH, (who also took charge as the command of Tinkle late when it was formed), when most other publishers had rejected the concept. Later, he took on the role of writer, editor, and publisher. The series went on to become a publishing milestone for the Indian comic book scene, selling over 90 million copies of about 440 titles (as per the last count until the end of 2008).[5] He has also launched the popular series.
 
Rajani Thindiath took over as editor-in-chief in 2010 and ran the magazine for a decade before moving on from the role in January 2021. During her tenure as editor, she created two brand-new series for Tinkle. The first was SuperWeirdos, a series about a set of teenagers with super-weird powers, The series encouraged readers to embrace their uniqueness. The second series she created was YogYodhas, centered on two siblings, Bir and Bala, who are the latest in a long line of yogic warriors who can manifest spirit creatures called *praanis*. These *praanis* come to their aid in the YogYodhas' fight against evil. Rajani was also responsible for opening up different genres within Tinkle; she launched Tinkle superheroes like WingStar and the aforementioned SuperWeirdos, introduced horror comedy for the first time in the form of Billy the Vampire (and later, Buchki and the Booligans), and created space for a boarding school series as well called NOIS!
 
While watching a quiz show on Doordarshan back in the 1960s, Anant (Uncle) Pai was disgruntled by the fact that while the participants knew a lot about Greek heroes and mythology, they displayed an embarrassing lack of knowledge on Indian mythology.
 
The senior consultant at a leading not-for-profit organisation in Mumbai says that it was reading these books after the passing of her grandparents that helped not only her but her parents to keep up with Indian folk tales in their cosmopolitan lives.
 
**The comics have grown with us**Vyas loves how her 11-year-old son reads the same characters in Tinkle as she once did. The same characters have been able to transcend generations, which speaks volumes about the craft of the stories. But this also comes with the conscious effort of keeping the characters contemporary and relatable.
 
They also published Women Pathbreakers recently, a book that documents legendary women in India through the 1800s and 1900s, such as Pandita Ramabai, who changed the lives of child brides and widows, Anandibai Joshi who was the first female doctor in India and Rukhmabai who inspired the Age of Consent Act.

**Free during the lockdown**After Prime Minister Modi announced a complete national lockdown for 21 days to slow the spread of coronavirus, ACK Media decided to waive the subscription fee for its online editions of these two series for 30 days.
 
My son loves reading ACK books. Having already read 100s of them, opening up the subscription for 30 days is a great boon. With the treasure trove of great books, he is hooked up to the iPad with ACK App installed on it.
