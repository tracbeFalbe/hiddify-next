I've gone through many of these discussions and nothing has solved my problem. Photoshop does not display my images properly, white is yellow. I've deleted and added new color profiles to Windows, I've calibrated new profiles to display as white, then importing raw images to Photoshop, they are dull and lifeless, in Lightroom the thumbnails are yellow, histogram yellow, but when I click on the image it's full color. How is this a corrupted color profile? The rest of my desktop looks fine. Also Premiere HDR videos look horrible and I've also done the whole "Color Override" option which did not fix it just altered it.
 
Ideally you should be using a calibrator to make your monitor profiles. If not, you're probably getting laptop/monitor manufacturer profiles distributed through Windows Update. These manufacturer profiles are very often bad in various ways.

For now, until you get a calibrator, replace your broken profile with sRGB IEC61966-2.1 in Windows color management (screenshot below). It won't be entirely accurate, but better than a broken profile.
 
If so, then the reason for your nightmare is not Adobe, but Microsoft, which has not been able to fix a bug in the color management subsystem of Windows 11 for more than six months (it appeared at the beta testing stage):
 
Carefully read the topic on the Microsft tech community at the link above, there is advice on how to temporarily assign a profile through the WCS defaults (it has its own limitations, but it can solve the problem for a while)
 
Try it. The problem with using a device profile in WCS is that the profile is assigned to the entire Windows workspace and uses a color engine from Microsoft. On the one hand, this solves the problem, but on the other hand, programs with their own color management system (such as Adobe products) still do not see the monitor profile and this can cause problems in certain situations.
I made the decision to return to Windows 10 until this bug is fixed.
 
I agree that this is usually caused by a display profile that does not precisely describe the actual display in use, and that it can typically be corrected across all applications by generating a custom display profile.
 
Also, if the display profile is correct then be sure to try enabling color management in Premiere Pro, which will make the color system respect and use profiles in the way that Lightroom Classic and Photoshop do.

Hey guys I'm having a really tough(since yesterday) time figuring out why my output in PS "Save for Web" is always in monitor RGB. This is really a nightmare for me (a beginner) for I'm trying to apply a job as front-end designer.
 
This is my second time to post question regarding this topic. And this one is more specific than the previous one. I don't really know my exact problem why my output in PS Save for web is always like this:
 
Until I came up with this site (How to Fix Color Profile - "proof colors" - Conflict In Photoshop). But the PS used in this site is CS2/3. Im using CS5. I did not yet uninstalled one of the color profiles because im afraid to mess out my display.
 
If you'd like Photoshop to match what you're seeing in your browser, and you're designing user interfaces, and you'd like colours in images to match colours in PNGs and GIFs, then here's how to set up Photoshop:
 
I am a small business owner and have multiple subscriptions to Adobe Acrobat DC that my team uses. I am also a photographer and subscribe to Adobe's photography platform that includes Lightroom and Photoshop. Beyond some minor complaints about how clunky it is, at times, to work with PDF's in Acrobat (changing colors is cumbersome, changing the properties of tools is cumbersome) I am satisfied with the products I have purchased.
 
I, however, HATE... with a white hot hatred... the way that the new "profiles" have been rolled out. I am constantly having to sign in and out of profiles to switch between apps that used to just work when I clicked on them... for example, Lightroom under my personal "profile" will not allow me to work with it if I am signed into my Acrobat DC account under my professional "profile" and there is no way that I have been able to find in Lightroom to rectify this... I have to log out of my professional "profile" on Acrobat DC (which closes every file I have opened) and then log into my personal "profile" on Acrobat DC just so that I can use Lightroom which was purchased under my personal "profile". I have not found an easy way to switch profiles without loggin in and out and when I reached out to support for help and to complain, I was given access to a video that did not help but which told me that I should love the new profiles feature... a feature I feel compelled to mention again that I despise because of how it has been implemented and because of the constant difficulty I face in using Lightroom / Photoshop and Acrobat DC.
 
Now... the preceeding comments should be read by someone in Adobe as a cry for help and I hope that there is an enlightened soul who will take this content and find some way to end the suffering. But, in today's environment who knows what will come of it... there may be people in Adobe who think that they are tech overlords and that voices of dissatisfaction like mine must be silenced. I may have, somewhere, violated their terms of service and they may fire me as a customer... LOL.

I let my subscription for LR / Photoshop run out so that I could just unify them under my business profile in the hopes that I would not have the problem. I had to wait for the subscription to run out because the Adobe store would not let me purchase an app under my business profile that I already purchased on my personal profile. Well, I have come to find out, I cannot purchase the photography plan under my business profile... it is not available under the business profile so I must purchase it under the personal profile.
 
Wow... this is really bad stuff and the kind of thing that should get some immediate attention as it makes things far more complicated than they ought to be... I will explain again just in case it is helpful in cluing someone in Adobe in to the problem so that they might fix the problem.
 
When I am logged into Acrobat DC under my business profile, there is no way to switch profiles without 1) logging out which closes every open PDF or Adobe application that is open and then 2) opening up Acrobat DC and then logging in again under by business email by inputing my email and password and then 3) selecting the personal profile... after this cumbersome and ideally unnecssary operation, I can open and work with Lightroom... I cannot, however, work with Acrobat DC unless I am comfortable without having the benefits that come from the paid version. If I want the full benefits of my acrobat DC subscription, I must log out of everything again and then repeate the process described above to log back in to my business profile.
 
This 100%. I can't find a workaround that doesn't make me sign in and out of the SAME email address for two plans and two workflows - both of which I'm constantly moving from one to the other all day long. I find it hard to believe that we're the only two people running two jobs. I have a team plan that I use for workflows and a lightroom CC w/ 3TB for the business I own. I used to go from one app to the other just fine. Now if I'm doing anything in any of the All Apps subscription and want to get back to my photos I have to log out (close all windows), log back in using the SAME email and pick my personal plan. There's no way to add my personal plan storage to my teams account or vice versa. If there isn't some sort of progress on this I'm likely to revisit my subscriptions. This is just wasted time.
 
Your answer does not address the issue of working for two clients. I'm not going to buy another $4,000 computer because I can't seemlessly move between subscriptions on adobe software. I'm glad I wasn't the only one to think this was an unhelpful answer.
 
I'm confused. If you're an independent doing work for clients, why do you need multiple profiles to begin with? Can't you just consolidate to one subscription/profile and use the same subscription/profile for all the clients? What's going on that you need to keep the work you do for one client on a separate profile from the profile used for a different client?
 
If it's a question of not getting their work products mixed up, that should be controllable by setting up your folders so that one set is for client 1 and the other is for client 2. If it's a question of allowing the clients to have access to the work product, you might be able to control who can see or access a particular folder so that clients don't see the other's folders and can't access them. I am not a CC user, however, so I don't know if that last is possible.
 
I agree this various profiles thing is excruciating. I pay for the Photography Plan and 2 seats of Adobe Acrobat. I have los
