This mode is for scanning folders/ hard drives/ external drives/ USBs or even networked locations. The whole process gets accomplished in 3 steps, namely selecting the target location, choosing the scan mode, and then launching the scan.

Next, you have to choose whether you want to scan for exact duplicates or similar ones. Exact duplicates are pictures that match each other bit by bit, pixel by pixel. Similar images are those images which even the naked eye can detect to closely resemble each other, but not close enough to be classified as exact duplicates.
 
The Included Extensions tab shows the image types that will be scanned in both the Exact Match as well as Similar Match scenarios. Please note that as of now, raw images can only be scanned in the Exact Match mode of the duplicate photo finder for Windows 11.

The Excluded Folders tab shows locations that have been omitted by default from all scans. These locations include critical directories which must not be scanned, or you run the risk of critically damaging Windows files.
 
When the scan is over, all the duplicates/ similar images will be listed out in a group format. The important point to note over here is that each group comprises of the same/ similar (as the case may be) kind of images corresponding to a single image. You can click any image and the Preview Area will bring up its preview and also provide useful metadata information about the image.
 
The final step is to click the Select Action button and make your choice. The Permanent Delete option will purge the photo files after getting your consent. If you select the Move to Folder option, you will get the Browse for Folder pop up which will help you select the folder to which you want to move the pictures.
 
PictureEcho provides a special scan mode for helping users scan their Adobe Lightroom catalog for exact/similar photos. The procedure is almost entirely the same as the system scan, except the beginning.
 
This section provides a very neat feature to the user. You can use it to view a summary of all the scans performed in the past, as well as restore data for all scans in which the Move to Folder action was performed.
 
While I believe the photos stand alone; I wanted to give some context. I've listened to the music of Amenra for a little over 10 years now, but I saw them live for the first time last August in Brooklyn, NY. While I try to avoid using a phone unless its necessary or for work, I was incredibly grateful for social media as it was how my friendship began with Colin H van Eeckhout, the vocalist of Amenra.
 
Because he reached out to me about working with the band more closely in documenting their time around the city prior to their show at Warsaw in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn, not only did I start a friendship; but I started to collaborate with a band whose music already means a great deal to me, and has only increased in meaning as I continue my friendship with the respective members of Amenra. These photos are from the time I spent with them starting in Berkeley, CA and ending in Los Angeles.

Caroline and Donnie met each other in college at the University of Kansas. They worked together int the greenhouse on campus. Technically, their first date was at the movies. They saw Jurassic World in 3D. Donnie paid and they held hands the entire time but neither of them can remember or agree on what happened before or after the movie. However, their first real first date where they were both on the same page was sometime later at The Melting Pot. This is where they both discovered that they care more about eating good food than having long conversations at dinner.
 
On a chilly October morning, Donnie and Caroline met me just before sunrise at Echo Lake near Idaho Springs. With hand-warmers in our pockets, we set out on a little adventure. Echo Lake is the trailhead for one of my favorite backpacking trails in Colorado. After we explored the lake and watched the sunrise over the mountain ridge, I took them on a mini hike to one of my favorite viewpoints or Mt Evans. Afterward, we drove around Squaw Pass to a gorgeous field I had spotted on a camping adventure a few weeks prior. With fall leaves turning late that year, there were still some golden, glowing aspen trees as a backdrop for their Echo Lake engagement photos.
 
In 2005 McDonald illegally hacked off a fistful of tubers during the annual lotus festival. He took the cuttings back to his Reseda home and grew runners for years before local officials came calling during a 2011 renovation project. In the end, McDonald sold 376 lotus plants to the city for a cool $30,000. From vandal to savior. Such an L.A. story.
 
My favorite place to photograph the lake is in front of the statue of Nuestra Reina de Los Angeles (Queen of the Angels). I will never get sick of this view. Just to the east, a covid testing center has opened this morning, and news crews are on hand getting b-roll and conducting interviews. Almost two years later and the pandemic is still inseparable from our day to day existence. I wonder what normal will look like when we finally move past this, and if that new normal will be anything like the old normal.
 
As I wrap up my walk I go past a man who, despite all warnings and signage, has brought a loaf of bread to feed the local waterfowl. He is not stingy with his portions, and the birds love him for it. The Duck Lord and his loyal vassals.

As some of the best smart displays and best smart speakers, Echo Show devices are popular fixtures in the kitchen or bedroom. While it can be informative to stick with the default rotation of news, sports scores and suggestions for the best Alexa skills, turning your Echo Show into a digital photo frame can elevate the user experience.
