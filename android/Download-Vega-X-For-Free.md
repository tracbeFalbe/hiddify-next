Vega-Lite specifications describe visualizations as encoding mappings from data to **properties of graphical marks** (e.g., points or bars). The Vega-Lite compiler **automatically produces visualization components** including axes, legends, and scales. It determines default properties of these components based on a set of **carefully designed rules**. This approach allows Vega-Lite specifications to be concise for quick visualization authoring, while giving user control to override defaults and customize various parts of a visualization. As we also designed Vega-Lite to support data analysis, Vega-Lite supports both **data transformations** (e.g., aggregation, binning, filtering, sorting) and **visual transformations** (e.g., stacking and faceting). Moreover, Vega-Lite specifications can be **composed** into layered and multi-view displays, and made **interactive with selections**. Get started

Compared to Vega, Vega-Lite provides a more concise and convenient form to author common visualizations. As Vega-Lite can compile its specifications to Vega specifications, users may use Vega-Lite as the primary visualization tool and, if needed, transition to use the lower-level Vega for advanced use cases.
