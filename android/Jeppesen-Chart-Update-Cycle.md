I'm really liking the updated Navigraph Charts and how you can have your plane from your simulator lay on top of it. Makes flying a joy. However it's subscription based and there's no way to have all the charts downloaded offline onto your machine just incase your internet is unreliable. Now with Jeppview, it's a full DVD with all the latest charts, and doesn't require the internet to use.
 
I really like the UI of Navigraph, makes looking at charts much nicer and the flow of it all seems much more logical. Only if Jeppview has a nice UI like Navigraph, it would be almost perfect, or if Navigraph would offer a complete offline database of it's charts for users who don't need to have the latest updates would be great as well.

Just a heads up in case you're unaware - if you happen to live and fly in North America - **FltPlan GO** - has a fully functional (FSX/P3D/XP) EFB for (WIN/ANDROID/IOS) - that includes georeferenced approach plates and taxi diagrams - all for the low low low price of - completely FREE... It's worth a look if that suits your criteria...
 
It is hard to beat Navigraph Charts.... I personally disable their SimConnect module because I have no use for linking my position to the chart; and it is true that you need a working internet to launch the application. It does download the charts by location and these are kept local so you don't need to download on every session but it will not let you view the charts unless it can validate you as a user by 'calling home.' As far as chart type, Jeppesen is good but I spent a lot of time learning LIDO and find many pros and cons for both of them. I learned with FAA Charts and flew with them exclusively for decades so of course that is my 'baseline.'

This discussion is of course all about personal preference (and indeed what one is used to) but I have to say I am really struggling with the Jepps. I've never been a huge fan and going to them from the Lidos (and the Aerads before that) seems like a huge backward step: some of the newer-format full-colour Jepps are slightly better than the old black and white ones but not a lot. Whilst the procedures themselves are clear enough, what I find the Jepps really lack is the bigger picture -- terrain awareness in particular. The new Navigraph Jepp enroute charts with the capability to draw one's route etc on them are better than the static Lidos before, but the terminal charts....
 
However, I finally took the plunge and got the subscription out for AIRAC and Charts from Navigraph. Very happy I did and well worth it as you can have some confidence in the up to date aspect of the charts, AIRAC cycles etc. Works on and off line.
 
There is a small piece of software you need to load on your flightsim PC to facilitate communications between the two devices... Needs to be run as admin but setup is a breeze... Simply launch right before starting your sim... Your mobile device and flightsim PC need to be on the same WiFi network segment...
 
Also If you actually have got a legit copy of jeppview (which I doubt the OP has) you dont need the DVD you could download by connecting upto the servers. If you have one of the blacklisted jeppviews you have to rely on the monthly DVDs for charts, the enroute data will stay out of date.
 
One of My best mate works for jeppesen ITPS in crawley, and my airline is a jepps customer we deal with them quite alot for diverts if we cant get handling or fuel agreements. Of the top of my head i think the basic Jeppview/360 subscription is 3000 GBP a year depending on how many licenses.
 
At the time, there was nothing like georeferenced charts on iPad, and displaying Jepp charts on MFD, with moving aircraft, was unmatched.
Also, one nice thing is that Chartview was able to auto-filter the database and show the right chart at the right time . For example, if you had loaded an approach in the GPS, entering Chartview would immediately call the needed chart.
 
Regarding the chartview.hif.sff file on the SD card with cycle 12-2021. That file is for a G1000 NXi charts subscription. Since the file has a modified date of 13 April 2021, it appears it was written to the card when charts cycle 07-2021 or 08-2021 was written to the card. You may have been set up for a G1000 NXi charts subscription back in April. However, currently, you are set up for a legacy, non-NXi G1000 system. However, a G1000 NXi charts subscription should also work in a legacy, non-NXi G1000 system. In that case the non-NXi G1000 system will ignore the chartview.hif.sff file.
 
This is due to a limitation of 32 terminal chart change notice NOTAMs in Garmin GDU software older than v15.25. For cycle 13-2021, France has 38 terminal chart change notice NOTAMs (1 General Terminal NOTAM and 37 General Terminal (VFR) NOTAMs). The number of terminal chart change notice NOTAMS can change from one cycle to the next, which explains why the issue occurs one cycle, but not the next.
 
So I decided to try something with Garmin. Escalating the levels of support as well, I was answered they provided a solution with a GDU software update, and that it was the TC holder (Cessna) to release it to its customers. As I complained, I received nice encouragement :
 
I do apologise for the inconvenience, however this is an unavoidable situation caused by limited memory on that particular software level, however, I am glad to hear that the feature does still function so you are in a position to still display the charts you need, albeit through a modified method.
 
Obviously I was not glad at all, and requested a contact at Cessna, to demand a solution. 
I also mentioned that safety of flights was involved, and found they took the problem very lightly. I requested an updated AFM(S) for the modified method but got nothing (obviously).
 
The only path we currently offer for meeting GDU software version above 15.25 would be to upgrade to NXi via STC SA01830WI per Garmin SB 1917. This will replace hardware in the aircraft and install software 2501.02, containing GDU version 20.05. Legacy G1000 software stops at 0563.26 for non-WAAS aircraft, and there is little business case to develop further software for non-WAAS installations as certification is costly and time-consuming. As Textron Aviation does not issue databases, nor do we issue NOTAMS, the issue at hand is somewhat enigmatic and outside of our realm of control. As I understand, the issue of chart loading will come and go depending on the number of NOTAMs loaded into a particular database cycle. Again, the only existing path to offer for this issue is upgrading to NXi.
 
Well, if releasing a software update was not possible, i offered two solution. Either upgrading my aircraft to NXi at their expense (so that I can benefit from chartview), either refunding the Chartview unlock card.
 
I don't get it, if the paper charts are legal for 56 days, why do I have to update my GPS every 56 days? What extra information am I getting with the GPS for /G filing that I would not get in a NOTAM? If my GPS database expires but my paper charts are still current (in other words, one is within the cycle of the other) what would I expect to be different?
 
I was doing a flight to KWMC in the vision jet and loaded up the RNAV14. When I started to fly the procedure I noticed the courses being displayed by the G1000 compared to my chart were all off by three degrees. I confirmed I have the correct Navigraph (Jeppesen) Navdata cycle loaded and my charts were updated as well. I thought it was a bug in the G1000 so I loaded the procedure in the 737 FMS and found it too was off by three degrees. I then loaded the same procedure in the citation x FMS and found courses were off by eight degrees.
 
In doing some calculations it appears the procedure is slightly out of date from the FAA and the G1000 and 37 FMS are calculating the courses for the TF legs using dynamic magvar. It is interesting that the Navigraph file has the correct final approach course of 144 being displayed but the FMS is still displaying its own calc'd value, which differs from the source/procedure. Is the 37 FMS GE functionality?
 
What I can't figure out though is why the citation x FMS is showing 8 degrees off. The magvar of the airport is 16E so being 8 degrees off doesn't make sense. Given the title of the citation FMS I'm guessing it's Honeywell functionality.
