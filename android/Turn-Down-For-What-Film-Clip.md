When I hit up the big homie Jon and asked him if he wanted to be on the track, this song is a pretty balling song. He heard the beat and was instantly down with the vision. What he sent me back, though, absolutely blew my mind. I knew Jon was one of the best, but he absolutely killed it on this joint.[6]

DJ Snake sent me the track with a sample and he wanted me to redo it with my voice. When I heard the song I was like this beat is too crazy for that sample. I wanted to make it hip and current, and the first thing that came to mind was the phrase 'Turn Down for What!'[6]

Actor and co-director Daniel Kwan, of the directing duo The Daniels There were three questions I had after watching "Turn Down for What" for the first time. One, how did the special effects team so realistically depict their protagonist smashing stuff with his penis; two, who are the complete freakazoids that directed this thing; and three, what does it all mean?
 
The video, directed by the LA-based filmmaking duo known as The Daniels, tells the story of what happens when otherwise reasonable people are coaxed into writhing, hysterical dance moves by a beat they just can't seem to resist. It stars director Daniel Kwan and his possessed, dancing penis, as patient zero in a twerking epidemic that eventually infects his entire apartment building. Alongside co-director Daniel Scheinhert, they've made music videos for stars like Foster the People, Passion Pit, and Tenacious D, and until "Turn Down for What" they spent a year away from music videos working on new material for television and beginning their first feature-length project.
 
Having shown "Turn Down for What" to the entire VICE office and all of my roommates, I realized that interviewing the director and protagonist might be a good way to get him to be friends with me. So I tracked him down and we talked about Brazilian facial butt-smash dances, racist YouTube commenters, and the nitty gritty details of how he broke a 2x4 with his penis while shooting this thing. Maybe he'll come dancing with me in New York some day and he can show off that adorable teapot dance he does so well. Eh?
 
**Was it nice to just break shit and focus on eye-candy rather than focus on concept or story line?**
Generally we come from a concept and we try to push that as far as we can and that's usually the glue that holds it together. It's usually a really dumb concept that we try to treat with utter sincerity, you know, in a way that makes people feel like, Really, they spent this much time on this idea? For some reason I think that cognitive dissonance is really funny to us.
 
It's almost like trying to turn someone on, just to upset them, almost like Antichrist. He does that in the worst way possible and I hate it. I hate that movie and I love that movie at the same time, and we want to do that in a more comedic way.

Cognitive reappraisal, or changing one's interpretation of an event in order to alter the emotional response to it, is thought to be a healthy and an effective emotion regulation strategy. Although researchers recognize several distinct varieties of reappraisal, few studies have explicitly compared the effects of multiple reappraisal strategies on emotional responding. The present study compares the effects of detached and positive reappraisal on thought content, subjective emotional experience, physiological reactivity, and facial expressions of emotion while viewing film clips evoking sadness and disgust. Although both forms of reappraisal reduced overall emotional responding to unpleasant stimuli, the effects of detached reappraisal were stronger in this regard, and positive reappraisal was more likely to maintain subjective experience and facial expression of stimulus-appropriate positive emotions. The two reappraisal strategies also produced somewh
